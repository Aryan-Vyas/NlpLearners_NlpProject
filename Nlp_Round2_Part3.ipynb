station was clearly of two minds about it but\\nfinally he buttoned up his raincoat and pulled on his hat and came out\\nto mickey groffs car sorry to make you come out in the rain like\\nthis groff said fill it up will you\\n\\nhe rolled up the window and picked out the least soaked wad of kleenex\\nto wipe the mist off the inside of the windshield the car radio\\nstopped playing show tunes and began to talk about freezer food plans\\ngroff snapped it off and leaned back to watch the turning dials on the\\ngas pump by the time the man had put back the cap and sloshed around\\nto the window groff had the exact change ready in his hand how far is\\nit to hebertown\\n\\nfive miles the attendant said and went inside without counting the\\nmoney as groff pulled out he saw the lights go out on the pumps and\\nthe big sign overhead\\n\\nyou couldnt blame him he thought there werent enough cars out in\\nthis rain to make it worth while he had been lucky to find even one\\nstation open\\n\\nit was nearly impossible to see the road no matter how hard the\\nwindshield wipers worked rain was spraying in somehow all the windows\\nwere closed tight but groff could feel the thin mist on his face he\\nrolled around a long downgrade curve and when he touched the brake\\nfor a moment there was a queasy slipping sensation the rain was coming\\ndown faster than it could flow off the highway\\n\\nfoolish to drive all the way to hebertown groff reflected but the\\nonly alternative actually was to take a bus the railroads didnt\\nbother much with this little outoftheway corner of the state and\\nthat was something to keep firmly in mind when he talked to the burgess\\nthe next morning he reminded himself an industryhungry town could\\nmake you some tempting offers there was a firm promise of a tax break\\nand bank credit and the suggestion that maybe a suitable factory\\nbuilding could be turned over to you for nearly nothing at all but you\\nhad to keep freight differentials in mind too and what about labor\\nsupply well no he crossed that off that was the whole point of the\\nburgesss cooperative attitude hebertown had plenty of available labor\\nten months of the year it was only when the vacationers came up from\\nnew york and the other big cities that local unemployment and the state\\nof the local tax rolls ceased to be a problem still what about that\\nwere you supposed to close down in the months of july and august\\n\\nhe shifted in his seat forcing himself to lean backit did no good\\nto peer into the rainand tried to relax mickey groff was a big man\\nand not used to sitting it gave him a cramped unwelcome feeling of\\nconfinement\\n\\nthere was a light ahead it turned out to be a store with a neon sign\\nthat said _sams grocery_ but it gave groff enough help to let him\\npick up his speed to nearly thirtyfive miles an hour he had been\\nnearly an hour covering the last twenty miles he saw irritably of\\ncourse it didnt matterit meant just one hour less to spend sitting\\nin the lobby of the heber house since there wasnt a thing he could do\\nuntil the next morning in this rain but why did he have to pick this\\nparticular thursday to come up\\n\\nhe passed the store and at once the road was invisible in front of him\\nagain he tramped on the brake slipped and skidded and straightened\\nout that was foolish he told himself he carefully slowed as the road\\ncurved again\\n\\nnot enough it was the other cars fault of course he saw the lights\\nraging at him down the middle of the road and automatically pulled over\\nquickly at once he felt the sidewise slip and sway of the skid but\\nit was too late to do anything about it\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nit _could_ have been worse thank god there was a good wide shoulder\\nright there the only thing was he seemed to be stuck in the mud\\n\\nmickey groff wasnt much of a waiter there wasnt a showdogs chance\\nof a car stopping to help him of courseeven if one came by theyd\\nhardly be able to see him anyway sams grocery couldnt be more than\\na quarter of a mile back along the road and from there he could phone\\nfor a wreckeror at worst if the wreckers had their own problems on\\na night like this for a cab to get him into hebertown once the rain\\nstopped it wouldnt be much of a problem to get pulled out of the mud\\n\\nhe almost changed his mind when he stepped out into the rain but by\\nthe time he had locked the car door behind him it was too lateit was\\nhard to imagine how he could get any wetter than he was mickey groff\\nhad heard of rain coming down in sheets but he had never experienced\\nit before this was something beyond all expectations in ten seconds\\nhe was wet to the skin in a minute he was drenched as a channel\\nswimmer there was wind with the rain too part of the time it came\\nswiping at him from the side stinging into his eyes infiltrating his\\nears slipping up the cuffs of his sodden sleeves by the time he got\\naround the curve in the road he was shaking with chill\\n\\nafter ten minutes of staggering through the storm he wondered why he\\ncouldnt see the lights of the store then he saw why and it was like\\na fist under the heart the lights were out there was the store just\\nahead but the neon was black the windows were black there was only\\nthe faintest suggestion of a glimmer at the edges of the glass\\n\\nhe went stumbling across a little gravel parking lot with water\\nsloshing around his shoes and banged on the door then he saw that\\nthere was a light in the back of the store it was a candle he tried\\nthe door handle and it opened\\n\\ninside the noise of the rain changed and dulled instead of a\\nslashing at his ears it was a drumming overhead a man came out of a\\nstoreroom at the back carrying a gasoline lantern and the whole store\\nbrightened and began to look more normal\\n\\noh said mickey groff your powers out i thought maybe you were\\nclosing up\\n\\nthe man said sourly i might as well be jesus did you ever see\\nweather like this in your life i been here\\n\\nhave you got a phone groff interrupted\\n\\nphones out too\\n\\ngroff sluiced some of the water off his face and hair well he\\nsaid somehow it hadnt occurred to him that the phones might not be\\nworking there wasnt much sense in going back to the car again he\\nknew a muddedin wheel when he saw one you could push blankets and\\nboards under those rear wheels all night and the mud would just swallow\\nup what the wheels didnt slide right off maybe you can help me\\nhe said im stuck in the mud down the road and ive got to get into\\nhebertown\\n\\nthe grocer glanced at him appraisingly and then bent to adjust the\\nflame on the gasoline lantern im all alone here he mentioned\\n\\nmickey groff waited\\n\\ni hate to close up before time the grocer said virtuously id like\\nto help you outyou stuck bad\\n\\npretty bad anyway i cant rock it out i was hoping to call a tow\\ntruck from hebertown\\n\\ni got a pickup truck with fourwheel drive the grocer said\\nthoughtfully youre welcome to wait here till i close if you want to\\nwouldnt be more than a couple of\\n\\nhow about ten bucks if you do it now\\n\\nthe grocers eyes flickered but he shook his head you dont know\\nthe people around here he complained they wait till im just ready\\nto close and bingo twothree cars come zooming up milk for junior\\ncatfood for the cat coffee they gotta have coffee they wouldnt\\nbother me if it wasnt so jeezly important sit down and wait mister\\nits only he squinted at the advertising clock above his door\\nshadowed from the flare of the pressure lamp by a stack of tall cans on\\na top shelfits only half an hour\\n\\nmickey groff thought of lying to the man giving him a story about a\\nmedical emergency or a big deal with a deadline something he couldnt\\ndecently brush off for the sake of two or three catfood customers\\nthen because he didnt like to lie he shrugged made a disgusted\\ngrimace at himself in the neardark and sat down in a spindleback\\nchair to wait out the thirty minutes he knew what the trouble was\\nit was the old thing he had been born apparently geared up about\\ntwentyfive per cent faster than most people this was very handy in\\nsome ways he was a rising young businessman at thirty and pretty soon\\nnow hed be a rising young industrialist his picture had been printed\\nin _nations business_ along with eleven other promising youngsters\\nwho owned their own plants and one day it would appear alone he knew\\nit and he knew it would be due to his builtin overgearing but that\\ndidnt make it any easier to sit and wait for the catfood customers\\n\\nthe storekeeperas most people didsensed his mood like to look at\\nthe paper he asked and handed him an eightpage sheet it was the\\nlatestyesterdaysissue of the _hebertown weekly times_ groff had\\nstudied the last four issues preceding it as well as those of a dozen\\nother country papers trying to get the feel of the communities they\\nserved on one of those communities he would soon have to stake his\\nplay for the jump from forty employees to a hundred\\n\\nhe held the paper up to the lamplight and read the main headline\\ncovering the three right columns the chair crashed behind him as he\\nsnapped to his feet god damn it to hell he said\\n\\nthe storekeeper backed away scared whats the matter mister\\n\\nsorry groff said i didnt mean you i just thought of something i\\nforgot to do\\n\\nwhich was a lie he forced himself to set up the chair again sat\\ndown and reread the headline pulses hammering at his temples boro\\nmay grant swanscomb mill to chesbro at nominal rent move hailed as\\nemployment boom old plant to be used as warehouse\\n\\nthe former swanscomb mill was the building he had his eye on as the\\nshell for his projected new factory it was ideal it was empty\\nand unwanted by anybody since swanscomb had moved south it was\\na lowmaintenance brick shell with plenty of adjoining room for\\nexpansion it was solidly built and able to support his machine tools\\nit had its own siding and a loading deck for trucks and somebody\\nelse by incredible coincidence was after it too the pounding pulses\\nsubsided and he steadied himself to read the story it was one column\\ndown the right and it was strangely uninformative it led off civic\\nleaders today hailed the announcement that arthur chesbro hopes to\\nsecure the old swanscomb mill from the borough as a warehouse for the\\nstorage of materials and supplies it didnt say who the civic leaders\\nwere it went on to recapitulate the familiar history of the plant it\\nconcluded by quoting arthur chesbro as hoping that at least a dozen\\nlocal citizens would be employed as warehousemen in the plant\\n\\n                                   \\n\\na cars headlights outside turned the streaming store window into a\\nsheet of refracted yellow glare a woman bustled in and peered about\\nuncertainly in the gloom the storekeeper yesmaamed her and she\\napologized for coming so late the rain was so terrible she could\\nbarely _crawl_ and could she have three cans of catfood\\n\\nthe storekeeper gave her the cans and when he closed the door behind\\nherrain drove in during the brief moment and drenched a square yard\\nof floorturned to groff and said what did i tell you\\n\\nwhos this arthur chesbro groff demanded the one in the paper\\n\\nchesbro a big wheel over in the next county justice of the peace\\nowns business buildings couple of radio stations the newspaper i\\ndont know the name i just get copies of the _weekly times_ they send\\nthem so i can check my ads every week i take one you look on page\\nseven tell me what you think of it\\n\\ngroff yanked the paper open looked at the grocers little ad on page\\nseven and said youre sam zehedi syrian\\n\\nthe man looked gratified howd you know\\n\\na couple of your boys used to work for me damn fine millwrights\\n\\nthats us sam zehedi said you give a syrian a busted machine and\\na wrench hell have it going in five minutes were a civilized\\nchristian people we been christian a lot longer than the french or\\nthe germans and you know what some dumb people called me when i first\\nbought the store an ayrab a heathen ayrab\\n\\ntheyll learn groff shrugged he studied the newspaper story\\nso this chesbro was interested in newspapers it looked it very\\ndefinitely looked as though he might have a piece of the _hebertown\\nweekly times_ in his pocket the story was pure propaganda\\n\\nsam zehedi went on oh theyre learning its been five years now\\nand i didnt let any grass grow under my feet im a respected man\\nin this community mister you dont hear any ayrab talk any more\\nexcept maybe from some of the summer people jewstheyre bitter about\\nayrabs but then somebody sets them straight i guess im the first\\nsyrian boy around here except for peddlers going through in the old\\ndays the way they used to its like being a pioneer or a missionary\\nhe glanced at the clock what the hell he said i dont think\\nanybody else is coming in this rain ill get the truck started and\\npull her around the front then you can hop right in and ill lock up\\nthen well go tow you out\\n\\nfine groff said i appreciate it very much the storekeeper\\ndisappeared in the back a door slammed and over the drumming rain\\ngroff heard a truck engine roar into life zehedi gunned it and held it\\nfor a minute and then took off swinging the pickup around in front\\ngroff dashed for the cab when the door swung open and vaulted in his\\nspeed hadnt helped him a bit he was wet all over again from his brief\\nexposure\\n\\nzehedi got out on his side sensibly swathed in a slicker put out the\\nlantern in the store and locked up he climbed back into the cab and\\nhad to raise his voice to be heard above the rain beating on the top\\nwell here we go mister about how far\\n\\nquarter of a mile maybe\\n\\nwell get you there he put the truck in gear and crawled away from\\nthe store feeding the gas lightly my tires are pretty good he\\nsaid id hate to start spinning my wheels though they crawled up\\nthe long gentle grade into the driving torrents\\n\\nnotice my stores located at the foot of the hill he chattered i\\npicked it partly for that people have time to see the sign not like a\\nflat straightaway where they go whizzing past fast as they can\\n\\ngroff cranked down the window and stuck his head out he couldnt be\\nwetter and he wasnt perfectly sure that through the rainstreaked\\nwindow his ditched car would be visible the headlights seemed to bore\\nyellow cones through the teeming rain without illuminating anything\\noutside their sharp margins the drops battered at his face and hair\\nhe pulled his head in feeling a little stunned the violence of this\\nstormhe had a vague feeling that it couldnt go on without something\\ngiving what he didnt know\\n\\nheadlights stabbed at their eyes from the rearview mirror behind them\\na horn howled and out of the darkness behind plunged a shape zehedi\\ngasped and twitched his wheel to the right the car from behind zoomed\\npast them cut into the right lane again and roared on its taillights\\nsoon were dim and then disappeared\\n\\ncrazy idiot the storekeeper gasped appalled he could have wrecked\\nus he must have been going fifty in _this_\\n\\ngroff twisted in the seat and stared through the rear window there\\nwere headlights far back but coming up fast and the headlights went\\nout as he watched with a glimmer\\n\\nhe knew suddenly what had given even a city man born and bred in city\\nsafety could recognize the signs\\n\\n_step on it_ he said to the storekeeper swiftly _floodwater behind\\nus get us to the top of the hill fast_\\n\\nzehedi didnt argue or hesitate few people argued or hesitated when\\ngroff used that tone of voice quickly and steadily he stepped on the\\ngas they whirled around the curve where groffs car stood empty and\\npast it it was a long straight upgrade from there either the rain\\nhad slackened off a little or zehedi was more worried about what was\\nbehind them than about the rain they roared up the hill accelerating\\nall the way and only stopped when they saw another car parked by the\\nside of the road lights on and windshield wipers flapping and a man\\nleaning out of the opened door staring back\\n\\nit was the car that had passed them zehedi recklessly stopped\\nalongside him making it a tight squeeze in case another car wanted to\\nget by the other driver misinterpreted the move\\n\\njesus he said thats a good idea keep them from getting past into\\nthat jesus\\n\\nhe was in a flap groff observed it wasnt surprising flood he\\ncalled but he knew the answer\\n\\nflood christ amighty the whole goddam atlantic oceans down there\\ni was trying to pass a lousy milk tank truck for five milesthey\\nought to widen this road you get stuck behind a truck on these hills\\nandanyway i finally got past him and all of a sudden i hear him\\nblowing his horn like a son of a bitch and i turn around and the\\nman choked jesus he said again that lousy little creek this time\\nof year half the time its practically dry and heres the whole creek\\njumping up out of the ground at me i stepped on the gas and got the\\nhell out of there he peered back nervously as though the creek might\\nstill be following though they were easily two hundred feet up you\\nhavent seen that milk truck have you\\n\\nit would be a long time groff was absolutely sure before anybody saw\\nthat milk truck again\\n\\nzehedi leaned across him hey mister you think there was much damage\\ndown there i own the store back thereyou know sams grocery down\\nat the foot of the hill\\n\\nthe man laughed it sounded very nervous not any more you dont he\\nsaid\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              \\n\\n\\nif you had smoothed out the crumpled paper to look at the ad you would\\nhave read\\n\\n                        goudekets green

dietary\\n    laws observed under personal direction of mrs s goudeket\\n\\nhowever you would have had trouble smoothing it out because it was\\nsoaked it had been thrown in the middle of both of goudekets green\\nacres by a dissatisfied customer raging at the malicious trick mrs\\ngoudeket had played on her by causing it to rain for three consecutive\\ndays\\n\\nmrs goudeket wearing a set smile that was ghastly even in the\\ncandlelight moved among her guests she was arch and gay with some\\nof them apologetic and sympathetic with others as circumstances\\nindicated but in her heart she was torn between rage and fear now\\nit rains for two months not a drop so the grass is dying and the\\ndug well for the swimming pools goes dry and the guests complain\\ncomplain complain its hotter than avenue a mrs goudeket and\\ncouldnt you aircondition a little mrs goudeket and frankly mrs\\ngoudeket what i wouldnt give to be back in our apartment on eastern\\nparkway right now we always get a breeze from the ocean and now it\\ncomes down pouring almost all of last week and now it starts again\\nso hard the lights go out and the phone goes out and theres a hundred\\nand sixtyfive guests looking for something to do\\n\\nshe told herself pridefully thank god mr goudeket didnt have to put\\nup with this\\n\\nnot that he could have handled it he would have retreated to his\\nroom with a stack of zionist journals written letters to friends in\\npalestine wistful letters saying that maybe next year theyd have\\nenough for a winter cruise\\n\\nthere had never been enough for a winter cruise mrs goudeket had\\nefficiently seen to that first things first a new roof before a\\nwinter cruise to visit palestine new pine paneling in the recreation\\nroom things you could lay your hand on and goudekets green acres\\ngrew because of _her_\\n\\nbut she had been kind and reasonable she had let him send a hundred\\ndollars a year for planting orange groves she had never argued when he\\ntalked about retiring some day and going to palestinehe always called\\nit that even after it was israelto _live_ she could have argued\\nshe could have told him plenty that this is america that here you\\ndont retire and doze in the sun here you drive hard and get big\\n\\n                                   \\n\\ndave wax came halftrotting through the dim rooms looking for her\\nhe started to call to her changed his mind and came close before he\\nhalfwhispered its the telephone mrs goudeket its working again\\n\\nah she exclaimed why are you keeping it a secret its good news\\nlets tell everybodythey can use a little good news you see\\nshe turned to the nearest coupletheyve fixed the telephone lines\\nalready i bet theyll have the electricity on in ten minutes you wait\\nand see did you call up dave\\n\\ncall who mrs goudeket\\n\\nthe electric company dave he shook his head go call them no\\nwaitbetter ill call them myself let him talk to the guests a\\nwhile she told herself grimly perhaps when the lights were on again\\nand things were back in their normal swing she would want to talk to\\nher guests again or perhaps she thought hurrying across the dark and\\ndeserted entrance lobby she would go up in her room and lock the door\\nand pull the covers over her head as she wanted to about once an hour\\nfrom may through september of every year since mr goudeket died\\n\\nthe phone was working all right but it wasnt working well mrs\\ngoudeket got the hebertown operator and asked for the number of the\\npower companys repair service but there was so long a wait after\\nthat filled with scratchings and squeals on the wire that she began\\nto think something had gone wrong she pulled out the jack and tried\\nagain on another line\\n\\nall it took was waiting it turned out while she waited mrs goudeket\\nhad plenty of time to think of the meaning of the long wait to get\\nconnected with the repair service not that that was any surprise\\nactually because she had been through storms before in the majestic\\nshawanganunks but always before it had been maybe a quick violent\\nthunderstorm coming up after a hot spell and it was a lark for the\\nguests because it was a change or maybe a violent autumn storm when\\nonly a handful remained but here were a hundred and sixtyfive who had\\nbeen penned in the hotel for days already and\\n\\nhello hello she tried to hear the scratchy voice at the other end\\ncan you hear me this is mrs s goudeket from goudekets green\\nacres\\n\\nthe scratchy voice was trying to say something but she couldnt hear\\nevidently though they could hear her so she went right on our\\nelectricity is off can you hear me our electricity has been off\\nfor two hours they fixed the phone lines why cant you people fix\\nthe power lines more scratchy sounds mrs goudeket listened to\\nthemfirst casually out of politeness then very very hard then\\nthere was a click\\n\\nmrs goudeket looked thoughtfully at the switchboard for a moment\\n\\nthis is new she thought her mind was cold and alert she knew she\\ncould not afford rage the electric company here is not a good company\\nnot like the wonderful consolidated edison in new york city here they\\novercharge youby mistake they sayand here the meter readers are\\nunderpaid and insolent even with good customers like me their repair\\nmen are unshaven and lazy and when they finally get to you they stretch\\nout a job forever so they dont have to hurry on to the next but this\\nis new this hanging up im no fool not after thirty years in the\\nresort business i know their phone girls are under orders to kid the\\ncustomers along promise anything _not to hang up_\\n\\nsomething must be happening something bad\\n\\nshe walked slowly into the lobby with a mechanical smile for each\\nsullenly accusing guest at the cigar stand she told little mr semmel\\na pack of cigarettes any kind\\n\\nhe raised his eyebrows and passed one over as she clumsily tore open\\nthe pack extracted one and lit it he began to grumble some hotel\\nsome lightandpower company by now i should be getting the overnight\\nlines for monmouth hialeah and sportsmans by now i should have\\nbooked two hundred dollars on tomorrow believe me mrs goudeket this\\nis my last year at green acres this kind of thing doesnt happen up at\\nnew hampshire notch i dont pay good money for the concession so this\\nkind of thing happens\\n\\na fattish redfaced man bulged up to the counter breathing whiskey\\nat them thats a young married mrs goudeket thought with distaste\\nthats what i have to take at this place because i cant get enough\\nnice young people sammy the redfaced man complained hoarsely\\nisnt the damn ticker working yet ive got fifty bucks i have to\\nplay youre busting my system to hell\\n\\nmr semmel said politely ill see mr babin he opened the plywood\\ndoor behind the stand looked into the little room where the teletype\\nhorse ticker stood and closed the door again im sorry mr babin\\nhe said with a look at mrs goudeket i think the wires okay but\\nyou got to have power to run the machine and there isnt any power if\\nit comes on later maybe i can phone chicago for a repeatif theres\\ntime before midnight\\n\\nnuts babin said and headed through the candlelit gloom for the bar\\n\\nyou see mr semmel hissed in a hatefilled whisper you see what\\nyoure costing me never again mrs goudeket\\n\\nshe wandered off preoccupied semmel was a nobody a clerk hired by\\nthe big brokers in spite of his pretensions but if the brokers in\\ntheir cold and analytical way did decide at the end of the season\\nthat goudekets green acres didnt handle enough to make the operation\\nworth their while next year nobody would come around and bid for the\\nhorsebook concession and it was the concession that pushed the resort\\nover the line between red and black ink\\n\\nyou had to make money and you had to grow mr goudeket had never\\nunderstood that orange trees were all very well but since  she\\nhad been the driver the doer the builder and mr goudeket had never\\ngot to palestine after all which showed that dreaming got you nowhere\\nshe felt a guilty twinge one year they could have made the cruise\\none year there had been nothing urgent which is a miraculous year\\nin the resort business she had put the money aside as a reserve and\\nsaid nothing about it and poor mr goudeket couldnt understand a\\nfinancial statement the guests loved him his zionist connections had\\nbeen valuable though he never suspected it and he had been a fine\\nallaround handyman since the days in the brighton beach boarding\\nhouse he had saved them thousands of dollars with his clever hands and\\nbrought in thousands of dollars with his connections but grow he had\\nnever understood and so he never got to see palestine what of it\\nanyway and again mrs goudeket felt the guilty twinge\\n\\nshe peered into the bar it was doing a good business by candlelight\\nher young marriedsshe grimacedwere getting drunk early dave wax\\nwas on a barstool with an ontherocks glass in front of him he was\\ntelling one of his stories\\n\\ndave she said softly when youve finished your drink why dont you\\ngive a little show for the people outside\\n\\nthe comedian theatrically gulped from his glass and told his barmates\\nloudly i love this dear lady just like my mother she is just like\\nmy motheralways hollering _get to work ya bum_\\n\\nhe pranced out grinning on the tide of halfdrunk laughter she\\nwatched him from the bar for a minute he went looping through the room\\nloudly announcing a oneman show by that star of stage screen tv and\\nradio dave wax also available for weddings and bar mitzvahs call\\nmurray hill it went trailing on and on and on as he led\\nthem to circle him around the piano he pounded out the introductory\\nchords of his nervous in the service routine which was very funny\\nand not too dirty from there she hoped hed go into a community sing\\nthat would calm the people down\\n\\nshe went to the switchboard again and snapped the toggle for the\\noutside line try the electric company get some kind of a real promise\\nout of them maybe bully her way through to the load dispatcher a\\nreally responsible person not like their phone girls\\n\\nhello she said operator hello the line wasnt stonecold dead\\nbut it wasnt buzzing with the reassuring familiarity of the dial\\ntone a delusive droning kept encouraging her to try mechanically\\nshe switched off and on again asked for the operator tried dialing\\nvarious service numbers as she went through the motions she thought\\nabstractedly that something had to work the horsebook concession\\nwas absolutely vital shed always known she should have an auxiliary\\ngenerator paid for god knows how so the teletype could be kept\\ngoingbut what good was a teletype with power and no line in it was\\ndawning on her that the place was cut off from the outside world that\\nthe wires were down and would stay down for hours\\n\\nradios the radio must be saying something there was a little station\\nin hebertown that played nothing but records and news a couple of times\\na day from the _weekly times_ office junk like whos in the hospital\\nthe borough council meeting want ads of the air traffic things\\n_theyd_ know what this rain was doing theyd have an estimate from\\nthe power and phone companies of the damage to the lines and when\\ntheyd be back in service\\n\\nthe radio would tell her everything she needed to know then a calm\\nannouncement to the guests and everybody would go to bed cheerfully\\nrather enjoying the excitement\\n\\nbut little mrs fiedler came up and she had her portable radio in her\\nhand weighing her down like a suitcase it wasnt one of those little\\npocket jobs but a substantial longrange outfit little mrs fiedler\\nmade something of a nuisance of herself when she played it beside the\\nswimming poolhighbrow music from new york city stations\\n\\ncould you get me an outside line mrs goudeket she said i want to\\ncall my mother in new york so she wont worry\\n\\nworry about somebody at goudekets green acres the old woman\\nkidded she should have such worries but im sorry the phones out\\nagain i dont know for how long but why should she worry\\n\\nthere was a news broadcast from new york theres a flood up in\\nrichardstown of course thats a hundred miles away but to my mother\\nthe mountains are the mountains\\n\\nah richardstown mrs fiedler did you try the local station lets\\ngo into my office and see what they have to say\\n\\nbut even the big powerful portable failed to pick up the local\\nstation mrs goudeket refused to think of what _that_ might mean\\n\\nalone again she realized that shed have to send somebody out into\\nthat terrible rain send them to town the _times_ office or any other\\nphone they could reach she had to know what was coming next send who\\nnot the bartender he was the most valuable man on the premises right\\nnow dave wax was next and the kitchen help couldnt be spared dick\\nmccue the golf pronineteen years old doubling in trumpetwhere\\nwas _he_ he should be in the social hall backing up dave wax keeping\\nthe people busy keeping their minds offwhatever it was where _was_\\nhe\\n\\nand then she thought distastefully of exactly whom shed have to\\nsend sharon froman she called herself and in the wild week before\\nopening she had let sharon froman foist herself on green acres as a\\npublicity directorjust room board ten a week for the season at\\nfirst sharon froman had actually worked she had written good stories\\nthat actually appeared not cut too badly in the issues of the new\\nyork _post_ which also carried green acres advertisements maybe she\\nhad even got them a couple of guests that lasted for about ten days\\nand then sharon froman had slowly withdrawn from any hotel activity\\nexcept eating when you passed her room at any time of the day or night\\nyou were as likely as not to hear the muffled thudding of a noiseless\\nportable when mrs goudeket barged in or met her in the dining room\\nand asked how the publicity stories were coming sharon froman would\\nsmile vaguely teasingly and say something that didnt after you\\nstopped to think of it make sense i think ive got a very dynamic\\nprogram lined up mrs goudeket and im polishing the rough spots\\n\\nblackhaired squarejawed nearsighted in her early thirties a\\npersuasive talkermrs goudeket was the living proof of thatgroomed\\neither to perfection or not at all maybe five feet six easily twenty\\npounds overweight sharon froman the perfect expendable to go out and\\nlearn the score mrs goudeket started grimly up the steps you better\\nbe feeling good and dynamic miss sharon froman she thought nerving\\nherself for a battle i got some real rough spots for you to polish now\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nin the bats nest that that sneaking old hag goudeket called a room\\nmiss sharon froman was lovingly recopying chapter one of her novel\\nher only light was a candle socketed in the sticky neck of an empty\\nsouthern comfort bottle and the flame flickered and turned blue\\nregularly as the wind swept through the closed windows what a shack\\nthought miss sharon froman not in anger but in judgment\\n\\nbut it had its compensations she could see the jacket copy for the\\nnovel now _spraddled evening_ is an odd book written at odd times\\nin odd places begun in a shabby trailer outside a mississippi army\\ncamp she grimaced remembering how perfectly foul ritchie had been\\nwhen shed had story conferences with don while ritchie was restricted\\nto the postit was shaped and polished by turns in the club car of a\\ntranscontinental train a coldwater flat in the east bronx a luxury\\nresort hotel and a jersey fishing village reaching its evocative\\nclimax while miss froman was well that you would have to wait and\\nsee thought miss froman taking page  out of the typewriter but the\\nend was almost in sight the first chapter set the tone for the whole\\nbook and now that that was nearly perfect it was only a dash to the\\nfinish line\\n\\nshe lit a cigarette from the candle before she put page three into\\nthe typewriter page three was the one that would do hesch in the\\neye hed be sure to recognize the savagely drawn feudalminded pants\\npresser if he read itand hed be goddam sure to read it if he had to\\nhock the watch shed given him to get the price sixty bucks that watch\\nhad cost out of her share of his christmas bonus and it was the only\\ndecent thing he owned so why doesnt he sell it she demanded of the\\nwind if hes so broke he cant keep up the alimony\\n\\nshe knew as soon as she heard the knock on the door that it was mrs\\ngoudeket the chapter went into the bulging file under the bed the\\nhalfpage beginning on the story about dick mccue went into the\\ntypewriter using the paper bail so old batears wouldnt hear the\\nratchet clicking come in please she called with just the proper\\nannoyance at being interrupted\\n\\nshe glanced coldly at her employer\\n\\nmrs goudeket sat down without waiting to be asked those stairs were\\ngetting steeper every day sharon honey she wheezed i want you to\\ndo me a favor frankly im a little worried\\n\\nsharon listened with minimal courtesy unbelievable she thought to\\nherself now the old harpy expected her to go driving out in this crazy\\nrain to find out if it was really raining so suppose she got into\\nhebertown what could she find out the lines were down they knew\\nthat and what else could there conceivably be\\n\\nsince it was a point of principle she knew what she had to say\\nim sorry mrs goudeket she said gently it just isnt my job\\nbesides the season was practically over so let old batears fire her\\n\\naw sharon wheedled mrs goudeket who else have i got believe me\\nits not for me its for all of us suppose\\n\\nno\\n\\nno shrilled mrs goudeket i feed you the whole summer for what\\none little thing i want you to do and what do i get listen here\\nyoung lady im telling you for the last time it went on for ten\\nminutes during which mrs goudeket quite forgot to worry about the\\nstorm\\n\\nshe was still breathing hard when she appeared at the door of the game\\nroom and signaled imperiously to dick mccue\\n\\nyou got to drive me into hebertown she ordered\\n\\nbut mrs goudeket he nodded back at the room where a couple of\\nsullen guests were doggedly putting golf balls into a tumbler i got a\\ncontest going dave said i had to help out he said\\n\\nthis is more important mrs goudeket said firmly you think i like\\ngoing myself god knows what the guests will think so dont tell them\\nlet them look\\n\\nall right mrs goudeket ill tell you what ill go get the car and\\nmeet you at the kitchen entrance just the two of us going\\n\\nmrs goudeket smiled frostily three she said miss froman is\\nleaving us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             \\n\\n\\nthe burgess of hebertown wasnt having any luck with his call to the\\nweather bureau because he was the burgess he had got his own line to\\nthe central office back in service but the central office was having a\\nhell of a time getting through to any point outside\\n\\nif he had got through he wouldnt have had much luck either because\\nthere were plenty of lines down but practically all the ones that were\\nleft were trying to get onto the same three instruments in the bureaus\\nouter office\\n\\nthe chief of bureau was talking into one of them kept open with a\\ndirect line to the nearest civil defense filter center charley\\nheres the latest no chance of the rain stopping for at least several\\nhours thats the big thing some places its hitting an inch an hour\\ntheres all that wet air that diane pulled in from the atlantic and\\nnow the winds have pushed it up when it gets cold the water has to\\ncome out how much he blinked at the phone he had been in that\\noffice for seventeen hours and he suddenly remembered hed never got\\naround to having lunch sent up call it ten inches average through\\nthe area affected what he sat up straight now listen charley\\nive busted forecasts and ive admitted it but you cant hang this one\\non me\\n\\nthe station duty forecaster on the phone next to him was saying\\nsure were sticking by our forecast go ahead and print it flood\\ndamage no i cant give you anything not our line please wont you\\nread the forecast we said heavy rain we said prospect of danger from\\nflooding because the soil is saturatedno room for the rain to soak\\nin it has to run off somewhere the only thing we didnt say was\\npositively he hung up but didnt take his hand off the phone it\\nwould ring again in seconds it didnt much matter what they printed\\nof course the newspaper that had been on the wire was in a town that\\nhad grown rich from the two rivers that joined in its heart and the\\nforecaster had his own feelings about what those two rivers might do\\n\\nhe took his other hand off the clipboard and found he had crumpled\\ntheir copy for the last forecast into a ball he tossed it in the\\nbasket hardly hearing his chief shouting into the phone next to him\\nit didnt matter he knew it by heart now anyhow but as the phone rang\\nagain he made a dive and recovered the forecast he smoothed it out\\ncarefully it might he suddenly realized be very important indeed\\nover the next weeks and months when the investigating commissions and\\nlegislative committees began sniffing through the debris\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nmrs chesbro came smiling into the burgesss office excuse me she\\nsaid i knocked but you were busy on the phone\\n\\nnot very said the burgess slamming the instrument down now he\\ncouldnt even get the central office again what can i do for you\\nhe didnt know the woman she was expensively dressed the burgess\\nwhose wife read _vogue_ realized that her flatheeled leather shoes\\nher matching waterproof tweed coat and cap her neat leather gloves all\\nwere imported and expensive for the rest she was a small blonde in\\nher twenties with a careful conciliatory look on her face\\n\\nim mrs arthur chesbro she said arthur and i drove over from\\nsummit to see you arthur let me off and then he decided hed better\\nmove the car to a little higher ground the top of that little shopping\\nstreet you have sullivan street isnt it after general sullivan i\\nsuppose and hell be right along and then you two can get on with your\\nlittle talk\\n\\nthe burgess looked at her vaguely her chatter only half comprehended\\nif she had been a man he would have said something like im sorry\\nbut im tied up now write me a letter and well make an appointment\\nsince she was a woman his oldfashioned notions ruled that out\\ni didnt expect mr chesbro he began ive got so much on my\\nmind right now with the rain he noted with wry amusement that\\nhe had started to say flood and changed the word civic pride or\\nsuperstitionthat i dont think this is the best time for a meeting\\ncould you go and head him off mrs chesbro it cant be urgent\\n\\narthur thinks it is she said a man phoned him from new york that\\nthis mickey groff is on his way and arthur swore around the house for\\nfifteen minutes and then told me to get out the car and well here i\\nam she could ask for a favor and keep her dignity im sure it wont\\ntake more than a minute arthur says its all cut and dried\\n\\nchief brayer came in without knocking his black slicker streamed and\\nhis mustache was limp henry he said to the burgess i make it\\ntwelve feet and rising at the sullivan street bridge in thirtyfive\\nit was only eight feet and in thirtynine it was only nine and a half\\nwhats going on down in the hollow god only knows anyway id better\\nget down there with all the boys all right\\n\\nsure red get on down send somebody to my place in a car with a\\ntrailer hitch have em tow my boat down to the hollow its all set up\\non the trailer in the garage ready to go he grinned wryly i was\\nthinking i might take bess up to cayuga for a day on the water\\n\\nmrs chesbro looked on blankly\\n\\ngreat the chief said its got a good spotlight too well need\\nthat if you dont mind a suggestion henry id turn out the fire\\ndepartment and have them standing by you may need some ablebodied men\\nin a hurry twelve feet and rising he hurried from the office\\n\\nexcuse me the burgess said to mrs chesbro and tried the\\ninterphone on his desk it worked so far the main to the north end of\\nthe borough had not been flooded and shorted out\\n\\nfire chief said the interphone\\n\\nthis is henry chief red brayer thinks and i agree that you should\\nsound the general alarm for the volunteers that they should be\\nstanding by in the engine house with their cars parked in the square\\nthe hollows filling up fastat least it must be the waters twelve\\nfeet and rising at the bridge\\n\\nright henry that all\\n\\nfor the present yes the burgess sighed he clicked the box off\\nimmediately he heard the klaxon on top of the building hoot three\\nlongs then pause and hoot again and then again it was the emergency\\nmuster signal and it would galvanize fifty men scattered throughout\\nthe borough into dropping whatever they were doing tearing to their\\ncars and speeding to the borough hall or more exactly to its ground\\nfloor left wing where the fire departmenttwo lafrance pumpers one\\nancient and one beautifully new two fulltime employees the chief and\\nthe driverwere housed he hoped they wouldnt be too disappointed\\nwhen they found theyd be on a boring standby\\n\\nand now he thought he really ought to get out and drive around\\non a tour of inspection there wasnt any point to sticking in the\\noffice with the phone out and the firemen and police already committed\\nto action he had hoped for some usefulness out of the local radio\\nstation but it was silent had been for an hour the news of the\\nhollow explained that the transmitter tower a modest spire was\\nplanted in a marshy field down that way it had something to do with a\\ngood ground he had been told once so they had a good ground and they\\nwere now bugged out the one time theyd be able to do a public service\\nbeyond broadcasting damnfool hillbilly music\\n\\nhe was reaching for his raincoat to the dismay of mrs chesbro when\\na big man came in the burgess recognized him as her husband the\\nredoubtable arthur chesbro of summit he had quite consciously had\\nas little to do with arthur chesbro as possible but there was an\\nirreducible minimum of contact with the man that couldnt be avoided\\nhe was all over the place in summit a closely neighboring borough and\\nhe had feelers out through the entire area you heard of his interest\\nin this and thatbankrolling a resort buying a professional building\\na county away and turning it over _fast_ snapping up timber rights\\nto a farmers woodlot and turning _them_ over to a firm from over the\\nstate line snatching an fcc television construction permit from under\\nthe nose of heavy competition and then not building the station after\\nall for mysterious and profitable reasons he was a leading citizen\\nthe burgess supposed but he had nevertheless carefully avoided him\\nwhenever possible he was not really sure why but once after a couple\\nof bourbons with chief brayer he had told the chief that he thought\\narthur chesbro suffered from a case of moral and ethical halitosis\\n\\nphysically chesbro was a picture of success rather soaked and winded\\nsuccess at the moment having hiked in the rain from sullivan street\\nand climbed the steep stairs to the burgesss secondfloor office\\n\\nhe grasped the burgesss automatically extended hand with a firm and\\nmanly grip its good to see you again henry he intoned hows\\nbess\\n\\nfine thanks\\n\\nand that boy of yours in medical school\\n\\nfineuh arthur he thought resignedly that you have to go along\\nwith these characters and maybe for gods sake chesbro actually did\\nremember bess and did remember hearing about ted and actually did wish\\nthem well maybe\\n\\ni see youve met my wife henry well it looks like quite a nasty\\ndownpour doesnt it\\n\\nnow hes talking about the weather for gods sake to put me at my\\nease and get the conversation going on a topic of universal interest\\nalways start by talking about the weather nobodys so shy or so stupid\\nthat he cant think of something to say about the weather well sir\\nthis time the maxim was going to backfire in arthur chesbros red face\\nglad you mentioned that arthur the burgess said briskly im\\nleaving now im afraid were in for something worse than we got in\\nthirtyfive and thirtynine and im going to cruise around and have\\na looksee i dont know why you came to see me on a dirty night like\\nthis but if you cant put it in a nutshell itll have to wait\\n\\narthur chesbro was disconcerted didnt you see the story in the paper\\nyesterday henry\\n\\nive been mighty busy the burgess apologized getting into his\\nraincoat\\n\\nwell it said roughlywell never mind the story what i want to do\\nis take the old swanscomb mill off the boroughs hands and put a tidy\\nrental into the communal pocket_and_ hire a few of your local people\\n\\nsounds fine the burgess said he started for the door but theres\\na fellow with a plant in brooklyn whos interested too i understood\\nhes coming out to see us about it but i suppose this weatherll hold\\nhim up i think wed better table this matter until i hear from him and\\nhave a chance to compare the offers now if youll excuse me\\n\\ni never thought said chesbro flatly that id see a neighbor\\nselling out to foreign interests when he has a bid from a local man\\n\\nthe burgess took his hand off the doorknob and looked at chesbro\\nsteadily up and down i dont like your language worth a damn\\nhe said id give you a lecture on manners if i didnt have more\\nimportant things to do you can find your way out cant you\\n\\nchesbros eyes dropped but the burgess thought he could read a look of\\ncalculation on his face sorry he said by the way my car is just\\nup the hill can i help out\\n\\nwell said the burgess and thought might as well save climbing all\\nthe way up west streetand you couldnt brush off a man who was trying\\nto do you a favor just because you thought he stank obliged he\\nsaid if youll drop me at my house ill pick up my own car\\n\\nhe waited with mrs chesbro while her husband dashed through the rain\\nshe didnt talk which the burgess approved and once when he met her\\neye she gave him a tired smile the burgess judged that she was onto\\nher husband and seldom had anything to smile about\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nfor that matter what did anyone have to smile about the burgess\\nlooked over his borough and hardly heard artie chesbro chattering\\nbeside him the street lamps at the bottom of west street were out\\none of the big elms that framed the post office was trailing a pair\\nof enormous branches brokenwinged across the street they had to\\ndetour far to the left to pass it well there wouldnt be much traffic\\ntonightand you couldnt tell maybe hed be lucky and the whole tree\\nwould have to come down and then they could get on with widening west\\nstreet and the hell with the garden club\\n\\nthey went up over the west street hill and down the other side\\ndont know if youve considered the importance of warehousing\\nfacilities in attracting industry chesbro was saying in his ear war\\nplants sure theyre a dime a dozen henry and they come and fold up\\nand then where are you but you take a town thats got a reputation for\\ngood lowcost\\n\\nthe burgess felt entirely too surrounded by chesbros with artie\\nbabbling on one side and the wife silent on the other then they\\nturned into sycamore the burgess leaned forward funny he could\\nhardly see the highway junction at the bottom of the hill they rolled\\ndown at forty or so and then everything happened at once something\\njumped up out of the pavement ahead of them watch out yelled the\\nburgess jesus cried artie chesbro slamming on the brakes and\\nskidding it looked like a figure some crazy kind of figure hard to\\nmake out in the rain that suddenly started to get up in the middle of\\nthe road it humped itself and flopped back and then leaped high in\\nthe air higher than the roof of the car\\n\\nmrs chesbro laughed out loud nervously\\n\\nbusted water pipe cried artie chesbro look henry its a whole\\nfountain\\n\\nit was a fountain all right but it wasnt anything broken the\\nburgess swallowed hard not in  not even in  had the storm\\nsewers backed up hard enough and fast enough to send their manhole lids\\nflying into the air\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             \\n\\n\\ndick mccue started off like a jet pilot whats the hurry mrs\\ngoudeket demanded better go slow and well get there she was\\nfeeling uneasier than ever because though she had heard the rain\\npounding on the house and seen the rain sluicing down the windows she\\nhadnt _felt_ the rain until that twoyard dash from the door to the\\nstation wagon that had wet her to the skin\\n\\nsure mrs goudeket he said cheerfully and slowed downbriefly\\nfast slowhe could drive that blacktop road down to the highway\\nin his sleep this was what he liked something happening he never\\nwould have taken the agencys offer of this job if hed known it would\\ninvolve running putting contests for rainedin guests who blamed it\\nall on him girls dances a chance to sharpen up his game for the\\nallimportant intercollegiate medalist next yearthe agency had made\\nit sound pretty great of course he had a lot to offer toohis\\nmaidenhead for instance as far as the world of golf was concerned\\nnow he was definitely and permanently a pro and some of the doors in\\ngolfing were forever closed to him maybe he should have held out for\\nmore money but what was the difference dick mccue knew well enough\\nthat his game wasnt going to support him all his life he had a good\\npowerful drive and a touch with the putter but everything between the\\ntee and the cup was hard work it made him a splendid golf pro for mrs\\ngoudekets guests most of whose future golfing would be either on a\\ndriving range or on one of those miniature courses that were coming\\nback but that was as far as his talents went dick mccue didnt kid\\nhimselfor anyway not about his golf\\n\\nmrs goudeket cried out and clutched his arm look four hundred\\ndollars worth of topsoil but it wasnt four hundred dollars worth of\\ntopsoil any more it was a lake she looked at it incredulously she\\nremembered distinctly what it had looked like when she and mr goudeket\\nhad taken possession of goudekets green acres formerly known as\\nholiday hacienda it had been a muddy cow pasture rutted and gullied\\nit had taken three days with a bulldozer before they could start\\nputting the topsoil on\\n\\nmrs goudeket swallowed as she considered where the four hundred\\ndollars for the next batch of topsoil might be coming from from the\\nback seat sharon froman called sharply watch yourself dick\\n\\ni see him mccue said slowing down a battered pickup truck was\\nwallowing around their entrance road trying to turn around the driver\\nwas being meticulously careful about staying off the shoulders which\\nmade it a long process but finally he got turned around and pulled\\nover as the station wagon drew close he leaned out and yelled this\\naint the road to hebertown is it\\n\\ndick mccue leaned over his employer to roll the window down and yell\\nback no you have to turn left at the road then the second right\\nleft at the bridgelook just follow me he barely got his head out\\nof the window before mrs goudeket rolled it up again\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nfollow him jeez i ought to have an airplane\\n\\nmickey groff said we ought to be nearly there by now does it look\\nfamiliar\\n\\nnothing looks familiar sam zehedi complained trying to keep the\\nlights of the station wagon in sight he stole a look at the dashboard\\nfortytwo miles theyd come backtracking where the bridge was washed\\nout taking a shortcut that had turned out impassable getting lost on\\nthe country roads down toward the riverfortytwo miles and theyd\\nstarted out three miles from town there was a mile marker right in\\nfront of the store\\n\\nno not any more there wasnt sam zehedi got a sudden cramp in his\\nbelly thinking about it the important thing was whether the insurance\\ncovered it or not he had the impression that he was covered for\\neverything from artillery fire by the argentine army to glacier damage\\nbut that was a long time ago when he signed that check for the policy\\nand he couldnt remember what it said about floods of course he told\\nhimself valiantly that guy in the car was nuts the store couldnt\\nhave been just washed away it was just that it was so dark and you\\ncouldnt see through the rain from as close as you dared to get in the\\ncar probably there was water in it surebut was that so bad look\\nat those people in missouri and places like that they go through this\\nevery year\\n\\nhe thought of the new freezer not yet paid for and moaned\\n\\nmickey groff snapped are you sick want me to drive\\n\\nsam zehedi swallowed hard im okay he said and he concentrated on\\nthe twin red lights ahead of him the beating raindrops that slipped\\ninto the cones of the headlights and out again faster than the eye\\ncould follow he concentrated on the feel of the gas pedal feeding the\\ngas delicately _youre driving_ he told himself _so drive and dont\\nworry_\\n\\nbut in less than five minutes he humbly asked groff you know anything\\nabout insurance\\n\\nsome groff said reluctantly he could guess what was coming\\n\\nwell to tell you the truth i dont remember what my policy on the\\nstore was like fire of course and extended coverage that means\\nwater damage doesnt it\\n\\nim afraid not groff told him feeling rotten under some special\\ncircumstances yesbut whats back there no if it were primarily\\nwindstorm damage with water damage secondaryfor instance if wind\\ntore your roof off and rain ruined your stock you could collect but\\nnobodys covered againstflood\\n\\nthe word was out in the open at last zehedi choked back a sob _youre\\ndriving so drive_\\n\\nbut in less than five minutes he found himself railing to groff that it\\nwasnt fair that hed lost five years of work that he would have been\\nready to look for a wife in another three years a good oldfashioned\\ngirl from the new york or detroit colonies of syrians somebody who\\ncould cook the oldcountry foodgod how sick he was of hamburgers and\\nsoda pop sometimes he looked at a hamburger when he thought he was\\nhungry and just put it down and walked away with a pain in his belly\\n\\nso why he asked indignantly a little hysterically didnt i stay\\nin the colony and eat my mothers cooking ill tell you why because\\ni wanted to be my own boss i wanted to be a pioneer its no good\\ncrowding into the big cities and working for other people in this\\ncountry you have to make money to be respected nobody respects you if\\nyoure just a working stiff all your life so i saved and i bought that\\nplace through a broker and ive been slaving for five years eating the\\nlousy food and thinking about broiled lamb im going to eat every day\\nwhen i find a wife and then\\n\\nhe subsided and the rain drummed down\\n\\ntheyre an emotional people mickey groff thought automatically and\\nthen cursed himself damned fool here you are thirty years old and\\nyoure babbling stereotypes to save yourself the trouble of thinking\\nwhy the hell shouldnt he be emotional with his store washed away i\\nseem to remember that when zimmerman slipped the old knife between your\\nribs with the trick specially printed discount sheet and cost you forty\\nthousand dollars you didnt have forty thousand dollars for him and\\nbrody to spend on likker and wimmen forty thousand dollars you might\\nhave airconditioned the plant with for better productivity and fewer\\nrejects you werent exactly philosophical about it your screams\\nin fact were allegedly heard as far west as council buffs iowa so\\nless guff please about any they who exist only in your head being\\nemotional or stingy or stoical or vindictive or for that matter\\ngenerous and goodhearted take em as they come one by one for what\\nthey show they are\\n\\nzehedi was under control again he said that guys driving too fast\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nwatch out mrs goudeket yelled at dick mccue watch out the white\\nposts that marked the sharp left curve loomed big too big in front of\\nthem mccue twisted the wheel and stepped on the brake pedal hard and\\nfast it was nightmarish to feel the rear of the car swivel around it\\nwas uncanny to see the road passing in front of him defying all his\\nexperience of perhaps a hundred thousand miles in a drivers seat the\\nwhite center line flashed across his vision and then headlights glared\\ninto his eyes it was the truck that had been following them the skid\\ncontinued for an interminable few seconds more sharon froman was\\nscreaming in the back seat the rear of the car jolted down and mccue\\nand mrs goudeket were thrown back against the seat as the front of\\nthe car nosed up metal crunched behind them then it all seemed to be\\nover mccue took a deep breath turned off the ignition and waited for\\nmrs goudeket to skin him alive verbally\\n\\nshe said panting with relief im sorry i yelled at you dick it\\nmust have made you nervous so that happened\\n\\nhe could have kissed her hairy mole and all\\n\\nif id been driving sharon began coolly from the back\\n\\nif your aunt had youknowwhats shed be your uncle said mrs\\ngoudeket tartly no remarks are required from you miss elegant\\nloafer sharon laughed\\n\\nboth wheels in the drainage ditch mccue diagnosed and we seem to\\nbe hung up on the transmission\\n\\ncan you get us out mrs goudeket asked\\n\\nno but that trucks stopped i guess we can get a ride\\n\\nsam zehedi laid his truck alongside the ditched sedan and got out\\nanybody hurt he called\\n\\nwere okay thank god mrs goudeket told him shakily but my driver\\ntells me the car is through could you maybe give us a lift into\\nhebertown well be okay from there\\n\\nmickey groff got outsoaked againand surveyed them you two ladies\\ncan fit in the cab with mr zehedi here the gentleman and i will ride\\nin the back\\n\\nwill you take these please sharon said opening the rear door put\\nthem in the back careful thats a typewriter and _very_ careful with\\nthat oneits manuscript and these two are just clothes\\n\\ngroff wrenched open the double rear doors of the truck and put the\\nfour pieces of luggage inside in the darkness there were crates and\\ncartons at least theyd be able to sit up instead of crouching on\\na metal floor as the driver of the ditched car passed before the\\nheadlights he saw he was surprisingly young and obviously shaken by the\\naccident get in he said it might be worse\\n\\nmrs goudeket puffing pulled herself up the high running board of the\\ntruck and slid in beside zehedi sharon followed and slammed the door\\nthe truck moved cautiously off\\n\\nin the dark rear of the truck groff and mccue had found milk crates to\\nsit on you all right groff asked the young man didnt bump your\\nhead or anything\\n\\nit wasnt that kind of stop mccue said he began to laugh im from\\nspringfield ohio he said between chuckles\\n\\ndamned if i see the joke fella\\n\\nwell mister in springfield ohio damn near every spring the little\\nold springfield river that runs through town begins to rise and rise\\nafter a week of this it spills over the banks and the sandbags they\\nput up every time at the last minute and downtown springfield is a\\nlake then everybody swears and gets the canoes and rowboats out of the\\ngarage and goes boating glumly around until the water subsides well\\nmister i came east to college because i was tired of springfield and\\nits foolish floods and i run into this mess\\n\\nthrough the windows of the double door groff saw they were passing a\\nsmall frame building with gas pumps in front it was dark cigarette\\ngroff asked steadily he didnt want to encourage the kids\\nnearhysteria\\n\\nno thanks but the difference is in springfield its slow and steady\\nand this is happening fast and when it happens fast sooner or later\\na crest comes along and then it isnt one of those years when you just\\ngo boating around its one of the years when you head for the goddam\\nhills and fast\\n\\nthen you think were going to have a flood crest\\n\\nhell yes thirty forty feet of water smashing down through the\\nvalley and when it comes mister wed better not be there because\\nthose things dont leave much behind\\n\\nthey were stopping now what the hell said mickey groff\\n\\nthere was a scratching at the double doors and one of the women from\\nthe ditched car climbed in grand central she called change for\\nthe downtown local follow the green lights for the shuttle to times\\nsquare\\n\\nyoure cheerful enough sharon the kid told her whats the matter\\n\\nwhy its nothing at all were just out of gas nothing else she\\nturned to mickey groff mr zehedis compliments sir and would you\\nlike to help him scout up some petrol\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthey found the blackedout gas station after squelching for a couple of\\ninterminable minutes through the sopping night\\n\\ni thought i had plenty of gas howd i know wed be driving all over\\nthe valley you said just a quarter of a mile down the road and\\n\\nshut up and lets see if we can get in groff ordered zehedis\\nwhining was getting on his nerves\\n\\nthere wasnt a soul in the station not even a night light probably\\nno power groff thought that meant no burglar alarms in case they\\ncouldnt find an unlocked windowthough hell he thought wryly\\nwouldnt it be nice if a state police car did come screeching up\\n\\nup you go he told zehedi clasping his hands to receive the toe of\\nzehedis foot\\n\\nlocked reported zehedi after a moment\\n\\nbreak it open with your elbow try not to cut an artery then when\\nyou get inside see if he jerked his head aside as glass tinkled\\naround him\\n\\nsorry apologized zehedi\\n\\ngroff heaved and got him through the window and went back to the front\\ndoor to wait he hoped to god zehedi would be able to unlock something\\nfrom the inside they would never get the women through that upper\\nwindow and he didnt want to have to break the front door they would\\nneed every bit of shelter they could get\\n\\nzehedi appeared tried the front door from the inside you idiot\\ndidnt you see the padlock groff thought sourly and made shadowy\\ngestures toward the rear he was yelling something but you couldnt\\nhear a gunshot in the crashing rain groff got the general idea in any\\ncase and stumbled around to the back zehedi let him in\\n\\nthe grocer was all keyed up that looks like a fuse box he\\nchattered didnt see a switch for the pump motors but it ought to be\\nright around there someplace wouldnt you say and therere some soda\\nbottles in case we cant find a gallon jug all we have to do\\n\\ngo get the others sam groff ordered he took his fingers off the\\nlight switch he had been trying though he had known what the results\\nwould be ahead of time no electricity you see so the gas will just\\nhave to stay in the pumps for a while\\n\\nhe closed the door behind the grocer and looked over their refuge\\nit wasnt much of a filling stationa couple of pumps out in front\\nan ice chest full of softdrink bottles and a little serving counter\\ninside they had come in through a sort of storeroom and there was the\\nchance that there might be something useful in there but it had looked\\nlike nothing more promising than the usual collection of old newspapers\\nand threelegged chairs there was a rickety stair to presumably a\\ncouple more storerooms\\n\\ngroff made thrifty inventory of what was on and behind the serving\\ncounter a coffeemakerno good no power though a cup of good hot\\ncoffee would have helped a lot easily a dozen cardboard boxes which\\nopened proved to contain peanutbutterandcheese crackers and\\norioles candy bars and bags of peanuts beyond their utmost powers of\\nconsumptionthey might get rickets but they wouldnt starve but\\nwater thoughthe place didnt seem to have any\\n\\nscratch water they could get by on the soft drinks or if worse came\\nto worst there certainly was much more water than they needed right\\noutside\\n\\na telephone he looked through all his pockets without coming up with\\nanything smaller than a quarter he slipped the quarter into the slot\\nand there was a mellow bong to acknowledge it there was nothing else\\nhe held the receiver to his ears for a good two minutes but the line\\nwas dead\\n\\nand then he found the greatest treasure of all a box of stubby\\nshort candles under the serving counter evidently power failures\\nwere not unheard of around heresomething groff reminded himself\\nautomatically to keep in mind when he talked to the burgess tomorrow\\n\\n_if_ he talked to the burgess tomorrow there was something there that\\nwould need thinking about too but the thing to do right now was\\nlocate some matches his own of course were more than merely wetthe\\nstriking surface had soaked right off them but there was a cigarette\\nmachine and fortunately a mechanical not an electrically operated\\none\\n\\nby the time sam got back with the others groff was busy by candlelight\\ntrying to brace a cocacola easel display to cover the window they had\\nbroken sharon froman was hugging the briefcase full of manuscript\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nyou dont last thirty years in the resort business unless you know how\\nto take your mind off your troubles mrs goudeket

next time he comes to\\nthe hotel she choked on a swallow of the soda\\n\\ndick mccue sat on one of the counter stools sneering at the spectacle\\nsharon froman was making of herself over that mickey

this was the nononsense sharon the\\nhardworking firstweekoftheseason sharon who was right by groffs\\nside when he needed a hand who didnt ask foolish questions who kept\\ncalm and ready and to think that as late as monday night sneaking\\nback to his own room he had begun to think\\n\\nsharon and the manufacturer came in from the storeroom with another\\nload of newspapers and dumped them all right said groff i guess\\nthats all well need they wont be very comfortable but maybe\\nsomebodyll come by before morning\\n\\ni dont expect to sleep much anyhow said sharon cheerfully she\\ntapped zehedi on the shoulder move your feet a little will you sam\\n\\nthe grocer started he picked his feet up so she could spread the\\nnewspapers and when she was through she had to remind him he could put\\nthem down again five years down the drain five more years of hot dogs\\nand that muddy water they call coffee ill be thirtyfive years old\\nand still three or four years to go\\n\\neverybody felt it at once\\n\\nthe wind ventured mrs goudeket they stared at each other the\\nbuilding seemed to be vibrating slightly\\n\\ndick mccue suddenly white stumbled across the floor and pressed his\\nface to the door\\n\\ntake a look he yelled that aint wind\\n\\neven in the blackness they could see the river that had been a road\\noutside the comb of current around the gas pumps the surging water\\nthat lapped at the door\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             \\n\\n\\nan air watcher it doesnt matter which one of the thousands he was\\nstepped from the hospital elevator at the third and top floor he went\\nthrough a door marked no admittance and climbed iron stairs to the\\nroof it was black and drizzling he hoped the rain wouldnt get worse\\nat least not during his tour of duty he had heard on a news broadcast\\nthat west of his area there were cloudbursts\\n\\nhe was tired from a long day at his appliance store on broad street and\\nhe was a little sorry he had signed up for this ground observer corps\\nthing but everybody in rotary was taking a shift so he felt he had\\nto go along he threaded his way around the invisible obstacles that\\nstudded the hospital roof and groped at the blackout curtain of the\\nshack\\n\\nit was dry and bright inside the little cubicle but somewhat crowded\\nthe man he was relieving yawned looked at the clockso he was two\\nminutes lateand said howdy ready to go\\n\\nsure everything quiet\\n\\nyeah cma flight  was early and south of their course so i phoned\\nin for the hell of it coffees hot\\n\\nmaybe later well i relieve you\\n\\nthe man passed over the night glasses and went yawning through the\\ncurtains the air watcher wiped the drizzled lenses of the binoculars\\nsighed and stepped out onto the roof he slumped into the swivel chair\\ntilted back in the patter of rain and watched the overcast sky with\\nboredom the little towns lights were bright after a few minutes\\noutside you could see how far they really shone and a few minutes\\nmore and you could see the lights of the next little town fifteen\\nmiles away as a dim haze on the horizon by the time his tour was over\\nthey would have gone out and everybody would be in bed light rain\\ncomfortably pattering on their roofs\\n\\nthe phone inside the shack jangledmost unusual\\n\\nhe blundered in through the curtains blinking at the naked bulb he\\npicked up the directwire phone and gave his goc post number\\n\\nfilter center said the phone is your town flooded\\n\\nno he said astounded\\n\\nhow much rain are you having\\n\\njust a light drizzle why\\n\\nthanks filter center said and hung up\\n\\nnow what the hell he gasped standing there with the phone in his\\nhand not realizing that heone of thousandshad just played his part\\nin alleviating statewide disaster\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthe filter center was in the basement of the colleges newest\\nstructure the physical sciences building its location was a lowgrade\\nsecret in that it was never published in the papers since it was\\nstaffed mostly by unpaid volunteers that was about as far as the\\nsecrecy went\\n\\nthe government had spent a lot of money on it in  the money had\\ntransformed an ordinary storage and heatingplant basement into an\\nairconditioned soundproofed office of enormous size there was a\\nhuge table with an inlaid map of the area this was the heart of the\\ncenter and the numerous other installations were designed either to\\nsend information to the table or take information from it information\\ncame by phone from watchers like our man on the roof his messages\\nbuzzed from headsets into the ears of girls who stood at a plexiglas\\nsheet ruled off in grids at word from him that he had sighted a\\nplanedirection traveling height and type if possiblethey scribbled\\nsymbols in chinamarking pencil on the sheet one of the girls around\\nthe map table then shoved a marker to the right spot on the map the\\nair force liaison officer constantly on duty at the table checked\\nthe marker against his list of submitted flight plans from the civil\\naeronautics authority and decided that all was well if the marker did\\nnot correspond with any submitted flight plan he picked up a phone\\nand called an interceptor base usually to find that radar units had\\nbeaten the filter center and its volunteers to the warning that jet\\nfighters had scrambled perhaps that the errant plane had already been\\nidentified as a strayed commercial flight and that the fighters were\\ndown again twice in five years the volunteers had beaten the radar\\nand the lieutenant considered those two times well worth the cost of\\nthe center and the boredom of duty there\\n\\nit was a very dull night and the lieutenant was looking forward to his\\nrelief when the call from the state director of civil defense came in\\n\\nhells busting loose lieutenant the director said succinctly im\\ngetting calls from here and there with spotty reports of flooding but\\nmostly from scared people who want to know whats going on and what\\nthey should do about it can you call all your air watchers and get a\\nsummary of the situation\\n\\nill put the chief operator on it sir the lieutenant said we can\\nput the reports on the map ill report this to group at once im\\nsure they can get a meteorologist here at once to try and evaluate it\\nfor you and maybe the army will lend us an engineer officer with some\\nexperience in flood control\\n\\nthe night was turning out to be not so dull after all\\ndiplomaticallyhe was liaison not commandhe filled in the chief\\noperator and she made a little speech to the matrons and girls\\ndetailing half of them to continue meticulously with the aircraft work\\nand the rest to start phoning the watchers the lieutenant rapidly\\ndevised a set of symbols to summarize the conditions at each point\\nhis weather studies helped there\\n\\nwithin minutes they were jotting them down on the map table one girl\\ncame to him with the question what do you do when you cant get a wire\\nthrough\\n\\nput down an _f_ he said for flooded\\n\\nthe director was back on the wire and he hadnt even called group\\nyet youd better send a man of your own down here sir he advised\\nsomebody from your staff who can do nothing but report to you\\n\\ngood idea hes on his way lieutenant\\n\\nhe got through to group the officer of the day first and then the\\nsleepy executive officer the exec carefully avoided commenting on his\\naction but said well send you a meteorologist pronto ill message\\nfirst army about the engineer officer meanwhile keep at itand dont\\nforget your primary mission lieutenant\\n\\nhe would not forget one of the girls at the plexiglas scribbled a\\nsymbol but nobody at the table picked it up they were too busy\\ntwittering and tutting over the grim picture shaping up along the\\nrivers of their state get that intercept he snapped at the girl who\\nwas responsible for the sector\\n\\nsorry she said burning red and picked out a marker to shove\\ncarefully to the right spot on the map multiengine approximately\\nangels ten bearing  the lieutenant checked his list it was cma\\nflight  a little off course\\n\\nand the girls kept calling from some alert watchers they got\\nunbelievably exact information relayed from local police or\\nnewsmennormal river depth present river depth rise during the past\\n hours condition of phone and power lines from others they got\\nonly brief impressions that there was trouble and how much from many\\nthey got nothing at all down the river valley towns on the map table\\ncrawled the menacing symbol _f_ over and over again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              \\n\\n\\nthe man in the winterized jeep unzipped a window leaned out and\\nyelled the burgess around here\\n\\nthe four soaked men working around the tow truck didnt even answer\\none of them gestured down the road with an arm and they went back to\\ntrying to get a line to a car that had gone off the road it was now\\nroofdeep in the torrent that had once been a drainage ditch and up to\\nfive minutes ago it had looked as though something was moving behind\\nthe windshield\\n\\nthe man in the jeep spat into the rain and drove on he finally found\\nthe burgesss car parked with its lights on along with a couple of\\nothers a few yards from the edge of the river that was crazy he\\nthought why didnt they park them up on the highway twentyfive feet\\nabove the water then he remembered that he was on the highway\\n\\nman wants you henry\\n\\nthe burgess turned around to face his chief of police if its that\\nartie chesbro again tell him to take his goddamn car and\\n\\nno lloyd eiseledont know if you know him hes got a dairy farm up\\nin the hills\\n\\nthen why didnt he have sense enough to stay there\\n\\nhis boys a radio ham henry hes got a message for you\\n\\nburgess starkman snapped at the man well\\n\\nthe dairy farmer said the kid has a contact with a phone line open to\\nthe civil defense filter center in springfield they want an estimate\\nof damage they want to know what help and supplies youll need in the\\nmorning and theyve got instructions for you he took a piece of\\npaper out of his pocket and handed it over\\n\\nburgess starkman said to his chief of police what do you think\\nshould i send somebody back with him to talk to them\\n\\nsprayragen said chief brayer promptly hes too old for this\\nanyhow let him sit down for a while he went off to get him\\n\\nthe dairy farmer looked around at the cars the fire engine the men\\nwith flashlights and electric lanterns moving around in the downpour\\nsomething happen he wanted to know\\n\\nyou could say that the burgess said wearily there was a boys camp\\na mile up the river its gone now and eight of the kids are missing\\nwe put a boat in the water and all that happened was we lost a boat\\nhe glanced at the dairy farmer howd you know where to find me have\\nyou been in hebertown\\n\\nthe dairy farmer nodded\\n\\nis it bad there\\n\\nthe dairy farmer coughed you havent been in town for a while have\\nyou he didnt look at the burgess the water was up to the corner\\nwhere the moose building isyou know somebody told me all the stores\\non front street are gone\\n\\nhe went on from there by the time the chief of police got back with\\nold sprayragen the burgess had pieced together an ugly picture\\n\\nas the jeep turned around burgess starkman yelled oh by the\\nwaythanks he looked blankly at brayer did you hear what he said\\n\\nenough brayer looked sick he burst out god amighty henry were\\ndoing this all wrong we ought to be back in town running the show\\ninstead of out here trying to do everything ourselves we ought to\\nhave twoway radio on the pumpers and a firstaid emergency truck\\nand an organization set up yearround with volunteers trained for\\nemergency work sure itd cost a little money but what the hell the\\ntaxpayersll stand for it something like this will make godfearing\\ncitizens out of them for a while anyhow\\n\\nsure said the burgess gently sure red you finish up here and\\ncome on back to town and well start over he left the chief of police\\nthere with his thick mustache running water and his old face worried\\nand indignant as he headed back to the car where the chesbros were\\nwaiting he thought reds a good man and hes right only he hasnt\\nfinished thinking it through yet we need all those things all right\\nbut after thiswhat taxpayers\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nartie chesbro was sulking if that powermad son of a bitch starkman\\nhad been willing to give him two lousy minutes of his time they could\\nhave got the whole thing over with and hed be back in summit by now\\ngetting a good nights sleep instead of catching pneumonia sitting in\\nthe car he couldnt even help out in their lousy boyscout acttheyd\\nchased him back to the car the second time hed fallen in on the\\npretext that they didnt have another flashlight to replace the one\\nhed lost so there went a fine chance to get starkmans ear thank\\ngod he told himself virtuously nothing like this could happen back in\\nsummit for two cents hed turn around and head back and the hell with\\nthe burgessthe old swanscomb place wasnt worth all this trouble\\n\\nor anyway it wouldnt be if it hadnt been for the signed option\\nagreement hed given the men from chillicothe ohio shut up that\\ndamn humming he snapped at his wife\\n\\nmrs chesbro laughed softly\\n\\nchesbro didnt even notice the burgess until the door of the car\\nopened hows it going henry he demanded cordially hope you found\\nthose kids damn shame about the camp but if they will build on low\\nground they have to expect something like this\\n\\nlets head back for town said the burgess he looked at the clock on\\nchesbros dashboard that couldnt be right twothreefour hours\\ntheyd been out here he counted\\n\\nthat was time enough to wash all of hebertown away he leaned back and\\nlet himself be weary he hadnt been up this late ininhe couldnt\\nremember\\n\\nchesbro was at it again he noticed abstractedly it didnt take him\\nfifty words to get from the flood to topic awhy the borough of\\nhebertown should ought and must give him the old swanscomb place but\\nthe burgess didnt mind chesbro was a saturationtalker his tactic\\nwas to hammer hammer hammer away never giving the other man a chance\\nto get an adverse word in and it wasnt too hard after all to listen\\nto the rain on the car roof instead he realized vaguely that that rain\\nhad been coming down awful hard for an awfully long time once he\\nremembered they had had a big summer thunderstorm and bess had read\\nhim out of the paper the amazing statement that more than four inches\\nof rain had come out of that one storm this had to be more than that\\nmuch more\\n\\nwhat about bess by the way their house was high enough up he\\ncalculated there wasnt much chance of flood water reaching it\\nbut had she stayed home it wouldnt be like bess to stay home by\\nherself especially when he didnt show up and the phones were down\\nshe would have tried to cross the highway into the borough and found\\nout that that was impossible then she would havehe checked off the\\npossibilitiesprobably she would have gone to her sisters house that\\nwas all right good location barring some freak like a falling tree or\\na collapsing roof\\n\\nhe leaned back his mind slowly going blank and relaxed under the\\nsoothing drone of the flapping windshield wipers and the pounding rain\\nand artie chesbros yatata yatata yatata mrs chesbro had let\\nher head slump onto the burgesss shoulders she was probably used to\\nthat maddeningly persistent voice maybe asleep\\n\\nhe glanced down at her\\n\\nshe wasnt asleep her eyes were squeezed shut with anguish and her\\nmouth was suffering not with physical pain the burgess realized\\nslowly that she was not used to the maddening voice at all and had\\ninfinitely more reason to hate its clacking than he\\n\\ncigarette artie chesbro said again now what was the matter with the\\nold son of a bitch he said more loudly cigarette henry\\n\\nuh sure chesbro grinned wisely the burgess had just come across\\npolly in one of her queer moods he reached over to the glove\\ncompartment matches here heres my lighter\\n\\nthe burgess spun the wheel of the lighter and held the flaming wick to\\nhis cigarette for a long second while he took three puffs mrs chesbro\\nmoved over a little the darkness outside and the momentary brightness\\ninside the car turned the windshield into a mirror he could see her\\ntortured smile\\n\\nthe brightness inside almost wrecked them as the burgess snapped the\\nlighter shut and you could see through the windshield again chesbro\\ngasped and tramped on the brake fast as he was the car was already\\nnosing into a surging stream that cut across the road\\n\\nthe engine chugged and died there was a long moment of silence how\\nlittle we know our land the burgess thought too tired for panic\\nfilled with resignation the hills and valleys we know and name but\\nthe little draws in the hills down which the heavens drain into our\\nriver we glance stupidly at them in a dry season and see nothing but\\nthis torrent before us is one of those draws no doubt we paid just\\nenough attention to itonly where it crossed this roadto bury a\\nculvert that would guide it in time of rain and thought we were through\\nwith it for all time but the rain began and first it soaked into the\\npasture and woodlot duff until they could hold no more the rain went\\non and raced in a sheet across pasture and cropland until it found the\\ndraw and gurgled into it and raced down the hillside safely channeled\\nhit the culvert with a gurgle and poured through and tumbled down the\\nhill on the other side and still the rain sheeted down and the culvert\\nfilled and when it was gorged to the full the rain still fell and the\\nwater rose above the culvert and blindly poured across the road six\\ninches deep a foot a yard and here we are try to get through and\\nblue sparks will snap from the sparkplug terminals to the wet block\\nthe vapor in the cylinders will not fire and artie chesbros pride his\\njoy his car will soon be a coffin for three drowned bodies costlier\\nthan any bronze sarcophagus\\n\\nbut chesbro was swearing and tramping on the starter stay in he\\nyelled as his wife halfopened the door ill get this son of a bitch\\nstarted or know the reason why\\n\\nthere was a lopsided chugging one terminal was dry enough it had been\\nonly spray and then the motor roared the car backed violently up the\\nhill in the dark there was a side road chesbro panted headed\\nuphill cant turn around on this damn thing wed go into the ditch\\nbut i can flip onto the side road when we come to it\\n\\nhe felt good this was what he was good at from high school on he had\\nbeen a fast hard driver who delighted in tricky maneuvering for years\\nnow he had been in the habit of passing anything on the road it made\\nhim feel good and he felt good now he backed the car roaring twisted\\nfull around in the seat and peering into the dark he remembered a\\nstraightaway and a left curve as the car backed into the curve he\\nslowed a little but not much and then they came to the side road\\nwhat did i tell you he cried happily theres the son of a bitch\\nright where i said it would be\\n\\nhe shifted and roared into the right turn up the hill where does this\\ntake us henry he snapped as from the bridge to the chartroom\\n\\nthe burgess smiled in the dark i dont know arthur he said how\\nlittle we know our land\\n\\neh the old man was tired and rambling too bad now it was all\\non his shoulders but when he got at him later hed remind him that\\nhe had in a way saved his life that he didnt expect anything for\\nhimself but that he wanted to do something for the community\\n\\ntheres a light screamed mrs chesbro\\n\\nit seemed to be a filling station there were the pumps and there\\nwas a twostorey frame building behind them one of those crossroads\\ngroceries chesbro thought as they swept past\\n\\nbut arent you going to stop arthur she asked\\n\\nnonsense dear he grunted we started for hebertown and thats\\nwhere were going\\n\\nhow little we know our land thought the burgess again for there\\nahead in the twin beams was a sheet of muddy water their speed was\\nsuch that they plowed into it with a tremendous gush of spray well\\nmake it chesbro cried water rose chillingly inside the car to their\\ncalves as they plowed heavily forward and then lurched to a stop\\n\\nchesbro said between his teeth like last time he ground the starter\\nthree times the fourth time he tramped on the button nothing happened\\nthe battery was shorted out\\n\\nhere we are mrs chesbro said inanely\\n\\nchesbro tramped on the dead button again and again\\n\\nits rising isnt it said the burgess lets get out and wade\\nbefore we have to swim\\n\\nhating him his wife and himself hating the car and the water arthur\\nchesbro opened the door more water swirled in seathigh lets go\\nhe said gruffly five minutes and well be in that filling station\\ngrocery whatever it was\\n\\nhe gingerly lowered himself into the water it came to his waist and\\nchilled the bone ill lead he said come on\\n\\nsurprisingly there was a strong current he had thought it would be a\\nsort of pond instead it was a temporary catch basin for the living\\nwater that was thundering down from the heavens on its way to the\\nriver and finally the sea they were simply in a low spot where water\\nwas detained for a while before rushing on the same cubic yard of\\nwater could wash out a power line running along a high ridge wash out\\na dirt road lower down on the hill pour through a farmhouse lower\\ndown smashing the windows and depositing stinking mud on the floor\\nshort his battery here trapping the three of them and still rage on\\nwith a long career of ruin before it it was the secret of the floods\\ndestructiveness\\n\\nchesbro inched his way forward taking care to keep the current abeam\\nof him feeling for the hardtop with his feet the burgess and his wife\\nheld the skirt of his raincoat one to a side\\n\\nhe stepped on something slippery and crashed faceforward into the\\nmuddy water it was the burgess who with unexpected wiry strength\\nhauled him upright again while he floundered\\n\\nfish or something he sputtered\\n\\nthey trudged forward deadtired after fifty feet of it the current\\nand the sullen resistance of the water itself but the level was\\ndropping about them as they climbed the rim of the basin in the land\\n\\nin ten minutes they kicked through inchdeep water to the road surface\\nwet only with the pelting rain silently they splashed along the road\\n\\nwait the burgess said abruptly they stopped he still had chesbros\\nlighter he crouched and snapped it alight the waters still rising\\nhe said following right along behind us as they stood there it\\nlapped at the soles of their shoes\\n\\nten more interminable minuteshard walking their weight increased\\nfifty per cent by their sodden clothesand mrs chesbro said theres\\nthe light\\n\\nthey shambled into a trot by unspoken agreement it suddenly seemed\\nvery important to them all that they should get to a warm dry place\\nshed their clothes eat sleep\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             \\n\\n\\nsharon froman shepherded the woman from the car this mrs chesbro\\ninto the back rooma queer one she was but that could wait take\\noff what you can spare and hang it up she said briskly efficiently\\nand headed back for the front room there had been something when the\\nwomans husband and mickey groff met sharon froman wanted to see\\n\\nthey were comparing notes on the flood and that was all right if you\\ndidnt have an ear skilled in detecting the grace notes of conflict\\nit might have sounded like any other strangers in common trouble but\\nsharons ear caught resonances beyond that take the womans husband\\nfor instance he was chattering away to of all people sickpup dick\\nmccue but his eyes kept wandering to mickey groff\\n\\nmrs goudeket scolded sharon the blanket for mr starkman you\\nforgot it\\n\\nhe can take mine sharon saidshe didnt want to go back to the\\nstoreroom just then she handed the holed greasespotted rag to the\\nold man then remembered and carefully draped it around his shoulders\\nthey stink she told him cheerfully and i think theyve got bugs\\nbut theyre better than pneumonia she grinned at mickey groff\\n\\nthank you miss said henry starkman he had not failed to notice\\nthat the girl was playing up to groff gold digger he diagnosed\\narchaically and without passion he was waiting for chesbro to switch\\nhis attention from the kid to groff starkman had sat enough hours\\nin the lawoffices of county politicians to smell the beginnings of\\na deal before it really existed chesbro wasnt ready yet he hadnt\\neven made up his mind to offer something to groffquite but it was\\nin the air pretty soon chesbro would turn to the manufacturer and say\\nsomething bluff and hearty like well i see were going to be chewing\\neach others ears off in the ring tomorrow and then if chesbro could\\nfind a private place to do it the two of them would be talking quietly\\nfor a while\\n\\nstarkman hugged the smelly blanket around him shivering he thought\\nquerulously whats the matter with bess i want my cocoa\\n\\nhe shook his head to clear it and got up to look at the rain outside\\nhe shouldnt be here at all of course what had the people made him\\nburgess for at that fat and soughtafter salary of two hundred dollars\\na year if not to be on hand when the community was in trouble and if\\na flood wasnt trouble\\n\\na sort of choking sound from mrs goudeket made him turn around\\n\\nthe chesbro woman was standing in the doorway to the storeroom in the\\nlight from the candles she had no eyes the ragged blankets she wore\\nwere robes she was blindly staring marble she had swept the blankets\\nspirally around her body and over her wet hair a hobble skirt at one\\nend and a turban at the other she was striking and she stood for a\\nmoment posed as though she knew it\\n\\nmrs goudeket made a tonguesmacking sound artie chesbro looked around\\nvaguely oh hello honey he said now this thunderstorm we had in\\nsummit in fortysix a couple of cellars were flooded all right but\\ndick mccue nodded mechanically his eyes fixed on the woman\\n\\nshe came over to starkman and sat down next to him at close range\\nthe costume didnt seem as extreme as halflit by the candles but the\\nburgess felt uneasy she was too close to him that was it she was\\nsitting on the floor looking up at him\\n\\nid better get you something to sit on he said and escaped\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthey managed to build a fire in the storeroomthere were a couple of\\nsheetmetal softdrink signs they raised one punctured for draft on\\na row of bottles and placed another one underneath to catch the hot\\nashes it worked mickey groff had placed his bet on the normal air\\nleakage around the window frames carrying off the worst of the smoke\\nand so it did it didnt pay to sit too close to it you had to watch\\nit minute by minute to keep it fed and keep it from setting fire to the\\nshack but it served to dry out their clothes and besides it felt more\\ncheerful\\n\\nthe men settled among themselves a plan for rotating guard\\ndutyguarding against fire and flood sam zehedi and dick mccue took\\nthe first shift one to keep the other awake they sat and looked at\\neach other they had nothing to say and besides it was hard enough\\nfor the others to sleep without their talking\\n\\nartie chesbro sharing a double pad of newspapers with his wife\\nschemed feverishly he hasnt said a word hes waiting for me to make\\nthe first move how much should i cut him in for or for that matter\\ndo i have to\\n\\nwell yes hed seen enough of the burgess by now to know that the\\ndeal he had optimistically outlined in the newspaper was out starkman\\nwouldnt cave in you could use the antioutsider theme just so far\\nand then you had to come across with something tangible for starkman\\nhimself or for the borough of hebertown on the other hand what about\\nthis suppose groff cooled off on the location after being stuck in\\nthis crazy flood they had down here maybe it wouldnt be too hard to\\nconvince him hebertown was a lousy ideamaybe even this was a chance\\nto do something with the old ackerman tract north of summit he doubted\\nthat groff would know a swamp when he saw one but suppose an hour\\nand eight minutes from now when they went on guard duty together as he\\nhad carefully arranged he merely suggested it to the manufacturer and\\nmade it sound good he wished his wife would stop that damn humming\\nin his ear god why couldnt they at least be home where they could\\nbe decently asleep in their own individual rooms\\n\\nasleep mrs goudekets face was curved in a smile she was dreaming\\nof  a bride the rooming house at brighton beach between her and\\nmickey groff sharons face was smiling too sweetly and trustfully\\nas she nestled obliviously against the manufacturer but of course she\\nwasnt asleep\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nsam zehedi sat torpidly over the fire waiting for the last of it to\\nburn itself out hed nearly dropped off three times and he and mccue\\nconsulting had decided it was more dangerous to leave it burning than\\nto put it out it did stink pretty bad he thought fuzzily putting\\nwater on it had been a mistake it smelt a little oily\\n\\nhe swallowed and rubbed his stomach that lousy candy bar he didnt\\nlike it he didnt want it why had he eaten it he wistfully turned\\nhis thoughts to pickled mussels wrapped in grape leaves now farther\\nout of reach than ever and a nice plump blackeyed girl to serve them\\n\\nmccue had dozed off he noticed a kid well let him sleep what\\ndifference did it make\\n\\nfunny he thought dizzily not even broiled lamb seemed attractive\\nright now he shouldnt have drunk that cream soda eitherhe gulped\\nand wrenched his thoughts away from that cream soda the smell of the\\ndying fire was getting pretty strong and he felt nauseous as if the\\nfloor were moving about underneath him\\n\\nnow the sleepers were turning and coughing there was something wrong\\nsam zehedi fuzzily thought he swayed to his feet and lurched toward\\nthe door clear the air he thought the last embers of the fire winked\\nout and he thought for a vague moment that he had lost his eyesight\\nhe flung the door open with his last strength and took a deep sobbing\\nbreath images of whitetiled walls greenpainted corridors swirled\\nthrough his head he was ten again and they were wheeling him along\\nthe greenpainted corridors to have his tonsils cut out morrisania\\nhospital\\n\\nhe fell heavily across the restless coughing shape of mickey groff\\n\\ngroff sat up slowly choking his head thudded as if with the hangover\\nto end them all\\n\\n_gas_\\n\\nget up he cried swaying get up around him they stirred and\\ncoughed\\n\\ngasoline fumes he yelled get up up the stairs move he\\nstaggered through the dark room kicking at them and yelling the\\nstairs were in backback and this wasa wall he leaned against it\\nit would be good to slump down and rest for a moment just a moment\\n\\nhe lurched along the wall to the corner to the open stairway that let\\nto the upstairs room over here he choked at them im standing by\\nthe stairs come on come on\\n\\none by one they stumbled to the sound of his voice and began to drag\\nthemselves up the shaky stairs\\n\\none two three four five\\n\\ncome on im standing by the stairs the stairs this way this\\n\\ntwo more to come two more some fool was striking a light a\\nbluegreen light to blow them to hell but no it was his eyes glazed\\nand burning that made the light two more to come\\n\\nhis raw throat and bursting lungs silenced him he lurched across the\\nfloor and stumbled over something soft he knelt took it under the\\narmpits and dragged it to the wall followed the wall to the corner to\\nthe stairs feet on the stairs\\n\\na young voice in the darkness choked mr groff come up ill get\\nhim can you make it young mccue strong arms took his burden over\\nand it bumped up the steps that was seven one to go he headed back\\ninto the thick sweetness of the fumes and crashed to the floor he\\nnever felt mccue come to his aid and heave him up the steps but\\nthrough it he was muttering one more\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthey were a sick lot when he awoke an hour later\\n\\nin the dark upstairs cluttered with boxes and cans mrs goudeket was\\nsaying the water it seeped into the gas tanks underground it must\\nbe the gas floated up and all around us on top of the water god be\\nthanked nobody lit a match and the fire was out as it was we were\\nalmost poisoned in our sleep thanks to that arab there was hatred in\\nher voice fifteen centuries of it\\n\\nburgess starkmans voice emerged from an attack of coughing hes\\ndead mrs goudeket you shouldnt he broke into coughing again\\n\\nmickey groff grunted trying to talk it was important to clear that\\nup his head was pounding but mrs goudeket didnt understand he was\\na syrian he croaked a civilized christian people\\n\\nmr groff said mrs goudeket youre better we were afraidyoure\\na hero mr groff you saved our lives except\\n\\nzehedi he asked\\n\\nhe knew that she was nodding in the darkness just as he knew that she\\nwas bitterly ashamed of her outburst too late she sighed ai too\\nlate dick went down with the handkerchief around his mouth and pulled\\nhim up the stairs his heart was going and then it wasnt maybe\\nfifteen minutes too late\\n\\na plump arm slid around him and sharon fromans voice said in his ear\\ntry to sit up we all felt better after we sat up she supported his\\nback and eased his trunk upright he thought his head would explode he\\nleaned against her dizzily and felt her cool palm against his forehead\\nbetter he grunted thanks\\n\\nthe burgesss old voice said abruptly sing a psalm for sam zehedi\\nthe sad syrian bess bess\\n\\nhes wandering sharon said very softly to mickey groff he wont\\nsleep\\n\\nmrs chesbro moved across the floor to the sound of the burgesss voice\\n\\nwhere are you going polly arthur chesbro snapped\\n\\nto the poor old man she said maybe i can talk him into signing the\\nlease before he takes wing\\n\\nnow what did she mean by that they didnt have a pen there would\\nhave to be witnesses groff was right there to break things up if\\nthey tried to pressure him it wouldnt work in a million years the\\nstupidity of that woman was sometimes absolutely astounding\\n\\nshe found the bony bundle that was burgess harry starkman how little\\nwe know  he was mumbling i was at belleau wood you know\\nleatherneck couple wars back they poured gas shells in for fortyeight\\nhours but the leathernecks didnt have gas casualties courtmartial\\nfor gas casualties not like the doughboys threw away their masks got\\nthrough belleau wood and here i am a gas casualty anyway thirtyseven\\nyears later ambushed in hebertown township the boys at the legionll\\nget a kick out of that he sat up abruptly and anxiously called out\\nbess\\n\\nshe soothed him and urged him down rest she said she felt and\\nunbuttoned his shirt loosened the blanket around her and spread it\\nover the two of them pressing herself against his bare chest\\n\\ni remember he said king solomon old reprobate but dont go away\\nchild he fell into an uneasy doze his breath rattling in his chest\\nshe pressed herself against him and lay still and silent\\n\\ndick mccue said i wonder if its safe to smoke\\n\\nmrs goudeket snapped in a situation like this you dont take\\nchances\\n\\ngroff said slowly i think its all right gas fumes are heavy they\\nhug the ground if we hadnt been sleeping on the floor\\n\\ni guess id better not mccue said uncertainly you cant smell\\nmuch up here buti wonder where the water level is now\\n\\nwell know in

it\\nstarts theyll woo them with sites with tax writeoffs with cheap\\nlabor rates theyll strip the area of industry clean as a whistle\\nunless\\n\\nmy god said chesbro appalled\\n\\nhe had never considered the angle but she was god knew deadright\\n\\nnor he reflected selfpityingly would _he_ get any such offers what\\ndid he have that would attract a mississippi chamber of commerce it\\nwas all intangibles that his fortune was going to come fromwas almost\\ncoming from already he assured himself panickily he had come pretty\\nclose it was only a question of time until the legislature

hotel let mrs goudeket come back and talk if\\nsomebody should do itwait a minute whatd you say semmel\\n\\nthe concessionaire repeated it the floods over demanded dave wax\\nthe roads are dry he staggered over to the window to see the miracle\\nfor himself\\n\\nsemmel let himself in they came in a boat\\n\\noh but it was no surprise it was still raining all right ill\\ncome down\\n\\nhe found himself hurrying in spite of himself it was only a couple\\nof minutes before he was hurrying through the lobby he saw with a\\nshock that the sofas and chairs in the lobby were occupiedguests too\\npanicky to sleep in their rooms too exhausted to stay awake they were\\nsprawled and snoring\\n\\nthe men from the boat were in the kitchen drinking coffee that the\\ncooks had somehow contrived to make im brayerhebertown police\\nchief you people all right here\\n\\nall right you call a hundred and sixty scared sore guests all\\nright you call wondering if the whole damn place is going to float\\naway all right i guess so dave wax said slowly he was almost\\nafraid to ask howhow is it outside\\n\\nthe man rubbed at his mustache its a flood he said succinctly\\nask me in the morning anyway were beginning to get a little\\norganized his voice took on a mechanical rehearsed quality dont\\nlet anybody drink water unless its been boiled for ten minutes use up\\neverything you can thats in the refrigerators tomorrow morning whats\\nin the freezers ought to be good till tomorrow night if you dont open\\nthem too often what you dont eat by then _dont eat_ throw it away\\nyou probably dont have any water pressure do you your own electric\\npump i guess all right youll have to set up latrinesuse chamber\\npots if you have to dump them in the river to empty themyoure far\\nenough away from everything here\\n\\nwait a minute dave was a little slow to grasp the implications of\\nit you mean even by tomorrow night we wont have the power back\\n\\nill consider us very lucky the police chief said heavily if\\nhebertown ever has power again\\n\\nhe got up they say that by daybreak the weather will be clear\\nenough for helicopters if you need anythinga doctor if theres an\\nemergency anything like thathang a white sheet out of a window and\\nkeep somebody standing by when a helicopter or boat patrol comes by\\ntheyll see it and investigate then you wave another sheet at them and\\ntheyll see that somebody gets here\\n\\ndave wax and mr semmel watched brayer and his boatman chug away\\nhebertown chief of police said wax isnt he a little out of his\\njurisdiction\\n\\nhe said they were looking for somebody wanted to know if wed picked\\nup any refugees god forbid mr semmel shook his head firmly a\\nmess now in new hampshire there would _never_\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nit was cracking daylight when brayer got back to hebertown he sat down\\nin the police station now an emergency shelter with men women and\\nchildren sprawled all over everywhere and dazedly pushed away the\\ncoffee somebody offered him he hoped he would never see another cup of\\ncoffee again\\n\\nhe said heavily henryll turn up i have a lot of confidence in artie\\nchesbros instinct for selfpreservation hell find a place to hole up\\nin\\n\\nsure red the head of hebertowns civil defense squad an\\norganization with an honorable history extending back nearly four\\nhours dug his fingers into the bags under his eyes and tried to stay\\nawake he owned a readytowear establishment on north front and he\\nhad once allowed the red cross to use his secondfloor storeroom as a\\nfunddrive headquarters a record of achievement which had done very\\nlittle to fit him for staying up all night i went down at eleven\\noclock to look at the water he said meditatively i didnt want\\nmy cellar flooded again like in thirtynine so i shoveled dirt up\\nagainst the windows and then i went home to bed he laughed he had\\ngone by his store again two hours laterin a boatand had had to bend\\ndown to look through the windows of the loft the red cross once had\\nused i heard on the radio a list of all the cities that were hitthe\\nworst ones they didnt even mention hebertown say what are you\\ngoing to tell bess starkman\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             \\n\\n\\ngray light filtered through the dirty panes of the secondfloor window\\narthur chesbro woke slowly aching in every bone when he opened his\\neyes stickily and peered across the grimy little room he could not at\\nfirst believe what he saw\\n\\npolly he choked amazement and outrage blended his wife apparently\\nunclothed was snuggled close to old harry starkman under a single\\nblanket\\n\\nshe looked up smiling hush she said i finally got him to sleep\\nhis chest sounds terrible and he has a fever but if he sleeps he cant\\nbe too badfor now\\n\\nshe got up gracefully managing to swirl the blanket around her without\\nshowing chesbro hoped _too_ much then he noted that the youngster\\nfrom the hotel was gawking he cleared his throat loudly and the kid\\nlooked away\\n\\nmrs goudeket grunted to her feet fever she asked let me she\\nwent to the sleeping old man and felt his forehead hes burning up\\nshe announced grimly an old man to walk through the rain and then he\\ngot his lungs full of gasoline fumes i suppose its pneumonia\\n\\nthey were silent\\n\\nexcuse me said mrs goudeket im going downstairs nobody should\\nfollow me until i come back\\n\\nmickey groff thought sensible woman somebody had to speak up he\\nstood for a moment over sam zehedi the poor guy had died hard\\nfighting it his eyes were ugly and his mouth contorted his face in\\nthe dim light was bluish the hue of a swimmers lips when hes been in\\ntoo long on a cool day\\n\\ngroff went to the window some time during the night the rain had\\nlightened it pattered now instead of drumming there was mist he\\nstruggled with the window and managed to inch it open against the\\nswelling of its frame and old incrustations of paint fresh air swept\\ngratifyingly through the storage roomand then he thought of the\\nburgess\\n\\nsharon froman understood his glance she threw her blanket over the old\\nman and said hell be all right she stretched stiffly the old\\nwomans taking forever she said\\n\\narthur chesbro said firmly mrs chesbro will be the next to go\\ndownstairs to find her clothes and put them on\\n\\npolly chesbro grinned amiably this thing _is_ scratchy she said\\n\\ngroff leaned out and peered through the mist all he could tell was\\nthat there was water below how much of it the enigmatic surface did\\nnot say\\n\\nmrs goudeket puffed up the stairs a big carton in her arms cheese\\nwafers she announced somebody open them\\n\\npolly glided to the door sculptural in her improvised robe and went\\ndown the stairs\\n\\nmccue with the appetite of youth and an athlete tore open the\\ncorrugated cardboard and began gobbling wafers from the first carton he\\ncame to\\n\\nmanners dickie sharon froman smiled he swallowed his mouthful\\nconvulsively and eyed her\\n\\nhelp yourself he said coldly youre no cripple\\n\\nwhy _dickie_ she purred after all weve _been_ to each other\\n\\nmrs goudeket looked up whats this she snapped\\n\\nsharon looked amused and said nothing\\n\\ni dont know what shes talking about mccue said the tone\\nautomatically indicted tried convicted and sentenced him for unlawful\\ncohabitation ill talk to you later mrs goudeket promised grimly\\n\\ndick mccue found the cheese wafers were ashes in his mouth he chewed\\nmechanically and wondered how he had managed to get simultaneously on\\nall these sob lists when all he wanted was a little innocent fun for\\nfree\\n\\nhe glanced at sharon sullenly and saw she was chatting animatedly with\\nchesbro about a publicity campaign enlisting all media the possibility\\nof newspaper and magazine space and radiotv time being donated if they\\nplayed their cards right tear their heartstrings out she urged\\nget editorials ive got some contacts in new york youd be the man\\nwho saved the valley mr chesbro\\n\\ncall me arthur he said were going to be working closely together\\ni can see that my prestige and your ideas\\n\\npolly chesbro came upstairs in her suit and raincoat they were\\nwrinkled and damply steaming out the smell of wool but they were no\\nlonger sopping she was carrying her blanket she draped it over the\\nsighing form of the burgess his breathing was almost a crow hell\\nnever make it without penicillin fast she commented helped herself\\nto a box of the wafers and began to eat methodically\\n\\nmickey groff looked around nobody was making a move for the stairs he\\nstepped over the body of sam zehedi and went down first outside into\\nthe drizzle where water was ankledeep he attended to his needs and\\nwent back into the store a bottle of pop caught his eye and he was\\nsuddenly burning with thirst he tore off the cap on a wall opener and\\ngulped it down as fast as the stuff would gurgle from the narrow neck\\nafter a queasy moment he ran for the door and made it in time the pop\\ngushed up again violently he sat down swaying on the wooden step up\\nto the door and retched a couple of times experimentally hed have to\\nbe careful eating and drinking for a while he had got a stiff dose of\\nthe fumes\\n\\nzehedis bluegreen wellworn panel truck was just visible down the\\nroad in water to the hubcaps looking bulky and competent the goddam\\nthing and there stood the two gas pumps goddam them too and if\\nyou could only get the pumps to work you could pump gas from their\\nunderground tank into the truck and away theyd buzz getting somehow\\ninto town where the old man could be pumped full of penicillin and\\ndosed with oxygen as needed instead of dying like a sick dog in this\\nkennel\\n\\nhe went wearily upstairs and said next\\n\\nsharon got up and said excuse me arthur\\n\\nkeep out of the cash drawer mrs goudeket said sourly\\n\\ndid you leave anything sharon asked wideeyed arthur chesbro\\nlaughed a laugh which turned hastily into a cough when mrs goudeket\\nglared his way\\n\\nmccue said suddenly i think the rains stopped they crowded to the\\nwindow he was right the drizzle had ended and the mist was clearing\\n\\ngood chesbro said theyll be able to get helicopters up its only\\na matter of time now until they spot us\\n\\ngroff said i dont think the old man can wait\\n\\nchesbro spread his hands eloquently what can we do\\n\\npack him in on our backs groff said\\n\\nchesbro said soothingly i dont think thatd be practical mickey\\nwere all exhausted weve all had a touch of gas poisoning we know\\nmore or less where we are and we know which way the town is but we\\ndont know what lies between us and the town we may just circle around\\nuntil we drop from exhaustion theres a better chance of us being\\nspotted if we stay in this place\\n\\nwere three ablebodied men groff said his temper rising we can\\ntake turns a helicopters just as likely to spot us on a road as it is\\nto spot us here chesbro _id_ like to sit here and wait to be rescued\\ntoo _i_ dont have a yen to go sloshing through the water with\\nstarkman on my back either but i dont think he can wait weve got to\\ndo everything we can\\n\\nive got my manuscript to carry sharon said apologetically\\n\\nwell _do_ everything we can chesbro said reasonably but whats\\nthe sense of endangering all of us uselessly the trip wouldnt be good\\nfor him and the womenmy wife isnt strong mickey she shouldnt be\\nsubjected to\\n\\narthur said his wife shut up\\n\\nshe smiled pleasantly at the gathering whos going to be the first to\\npack him\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nnaturally thats me of course dick mccue thought sourly sliding\\nin the mud im an athlete so they figure im superman or somebody\\nhe missed his footing and nearly fell they might just as well have\\ncarried him pickaback as on this door wrenched out of the upper\\nrooms from behind him mickey groff called time for you to take\\nover chesbro\\n\\nmccue relinquished his end of the improvised stretcher to artie\\nchesbro his arms felt wrenched out of their sockets and they had\\ncovered five hundred yards at the most\\n\\nthe rain hadnt really stopped not quite there was still water to be\\nwrung out of the scudding stratus and it came down in little bursts of\\ndroplets polly chesbro stumbled along beside the sick man trying to\\nkeep the rain off him when it came ready with a smile when his eyes\\njolted open and for a moment he stared wonderingly about him\\n\\nit was going to be a long trip they had had to skirt around a sort of\\ncontour line instead of following the road polly wondered briefly if\\nthere would come a point where the road dipped down into the streaming\\nwater and there wasnt any useful hill handy she didnt know this\\nroad at all had seen hebertown only once or twice before last night\\nhad only the vaguest impression of what the terrain might be like for\\nthat matter none of them knew much about the country they were hiking\\nacross on this day her mind inscribed in a crabbed hand our party\\nsuffered the loss of its two aboriginals reposing our destiny to the\\ncare of the greatest guide of all\\n\\nmickey groff was remembering the ligurian coast of italy the american\\nbombers had smashed it flat from anzio to genoa and groff had thought\\nproudly a little selfishly that no such destruction could ever come\\nto his own country but this was as bad at least as bad they had come\\nacross few houses but there were ominous objects sailing down stream\\nthat once had been houses and barns and all the other structures man\\nbuilds and his enemies sweep away he tried to reconstruct the terrain\\nas it must have been before the flood but there was a rightness about\\nthe broad sheets of water that made it impossible they were there\\nthey must always have been there why did people build their homes down\\nnear the water anyhow was a burbling brook in the back yard worth\\nhaving if suddenly unpredictably it could destroy your home\\n\\nhe wondered if the war department was able to look itself in the face\\nthat morning remembering the careful charts the colonels had shown\\nhim that called for dispersal concealment removal of such essential\\nindustries as his own suppose they had said gravely new york should\\ntake a bomb youd be out of commission you must move out of the\\ncity to where you can be safe since the production of your shop is\\nof great importance to the countrys defense and they had showed him\\nthe maps marked secret of the instrument plants in connecticut\\nthe explosives factories in the delaware valley the electronics\\nlaboratories along the jersey streams\\n\\ntwofortyeight twofortynine twofifty all right dick he told\\nthe golf pro you can take over for a while he surrendered the back\\nend of the stretcher and looked around\\n\\nwait a minute he ordered sharply whats that up there\\n\\nthere was a private dirt road slanting down toward them and something\\nwas moving they all set up a waving and bellowing and a group of\\nhorsemen appeared on the rim of the highway and came toward them three\\nor four of them picking their way through the mud\\n\\nthe united states cavalry said polly chesbro clearly is charging\\nto the rescue\\n\\n                                   \\n\\ntwo of the riders were men in chaps and sombreros and the third was\\na thirteenyearold girl they goggled unbelievingly at the litter\\nbearers they were from a dude ranch up in the hills and they were on\\ntheir way to hebertown to complain because their lights and phone were\\noff\\n\\njesus we knew there was some rain last night but we never had any\\nidea the cowboys stared at each other\\n\\nhow about giving us a hand mickey groff requested this mans in\\nbad shape if we dont get him to a doctor i dont think hell make it\\n\\nthe cowboys scratched their heads for a while and finally mickey groff\\nshowed them how to sling the stretcher between two of the horses hold\\nthem tight and walk them slow he ordered putting a cowboy at the\\nhead of each horse the ladies can take turns riding the other horse\\ni guess\\n\\nbut he got no customers for that mrs goudeket was scandalized and\\nthe young girl was too excited and polly chesbro wouldnt get that\\nfar from the sick man finally artie chesbro said offhandedly hell\\nno sense in _wasting_ the horse he was in the saddle before anybody\\ncould object\\n\\nit didnt make things good but it made them better mickey groff\\nwalking ahead reasoned that he had disposed his forces well\\naccording to the cowboys they had a good three miles to go on the\\nroad_if_ they could follow the road even approximately an hour and\\na halfdouble it because of the weathermaybe double it again he\\nthought worriedly if there were too many detours he looked back at\\nthe motionless figure between the horses that was stretching it but\\nthere was a chance the old man might hang on that long\\n\\nmaybe the cowboys first ideaslinging the old man across a saddle\\nbow and galloping awaywas the right one after all but no they had\\nto stick together at least until they found out if the road would\\ntake them all the way and besides thought mickey groff aware of his\\nlimitations but also aware that he had succeeded to the command of the\\nparty you have to make up your mind and stick to it\\n\\nthe girl came prancing up beside him you look like a good guy she\\ncommented here\\n\\nhe took the bottle from her it was a pocketsized halfpint of\\nwhiskey it was like a gift from god he took two measured swallows and\\nput the cap back on he could feel it biting in his throat invading\\nthe back of his nose spreading warmly through his chest\\n\\ngod bless you he told the girl sincerely\\n\\nsure but dont tell on charley will you i knew he had it but if\\nmrs koontz ever finds out shell pulverize him he started to hand\\nthe bottle back to her no you keep it you might want some more and\\nif charley gets his hands on it again goodby whiskey\\n\\nthanks he slipped it into his pocket then remembering the rest of\\nthe party turned and glanced at them mccue was plodding along head\\ndown chesbro was glaring at him mrs goudeket was watching but she\\ncaught his eye smiled faintly and shook her head good enough thought\\nmickey groff well save whats left he tried to remember what the\\ncurrent position was on giving liquor to old men dying of pneumonia if\\nit looks bad enough he decided well try giving him a shot otherwise\\nbetter not\\n\\nthe girl was chattering wont the old lady plotz when she hears\\nabout all this that joker on the horse back there says he thinks the\\nwhole towns washed away\\n\\ni doubt it\\n\\nthe girl was disappointed well she said i bet theres going to\\nbe plenty of excitement in hebertown anyway i always wanted to be a\\nnurseyou know not in a hospital a red cross nurse or something like\\nthat going away in the wars and all like that my sister was a nurses\\naide only they wouldnt let me in because i was too young\\n\\neh nurse he glanced at her quickly know anything about pneumonia\\ncases\\n\\nsure penicillin keep them warm bed rest\\n\\nthats enough thanks it had been a hope but looking at her killed\\nhope\\n\\nthey plodded on and came to a blacktop i know where we are one of\\nthe phony cowboys said straight on in to hebertown two miles its a\\nridge road it ought to be clear sailing\\n\\na car was buzzing in the distance frantically they flagged it down\\nas it closed up on them it was a latemodel suburban with a new york\\nplate in the rear man and wife in the front seat three kids rioting\\nin the back they all looked very strange to mickey groff and he\\nrealized at last what the strangeness consisted of they were clean\\nfed and rested\\n\\nwhat do you want the man asked from behind the wheel a little\\nnervously\\n\\n_what did they want_ penicillin beds warmth coffee\\n\\ntake us into town will you mickey groff said wearily\\n\\nthe man hit the lock button on his door and cranked the window up a\\nlittle its only a little way on he said evasively we arent\\ngoing any place special we just heard about it on the radio and\\nthought wed come and see what was up\\n\\nhe hit the gas and the car zoomed on\\n\\nsightseers mrs goudeket said wideeyed god in heaven\\nsightseers\\n\\nmrs chesbro was swearing\\n\\narthur chesbro was swearing and trying to remember what the\\nlicenseplate numerals were\\n\\nafter a while they trudged on there being nothing else to do\\n\\na helicopter came from the west as they marched dipped low above\\nthem and hovered for a moment while they yelled and waved the pilot\\npointed back into the body of the chopper with big exaggerated gestures\\nafter they had pointed at the burgess on his litter then he buzzed on\\neastward\\n\\nmickey groff said i guess he was telling us he was full up he\\nrubbed his back for a moment maybe he meant hell be back for us\\nbut he didnt really think so and the helicopter didnt come back\\ntheir way\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              \\n\\n\\nwhen they topped the rise and stood overlooking hebertown there was a\\nmoment of silence and then a groan of horror burst from them all\\n\\ngutted arthur chesbro said succinctly not a thin dime left in\\ntown not a nickel\\n\\nthe true flood crest which they had missed in the hills had left a\\nplain wake through the town it was dark brown and even from their\\nheight they could smell its stink sewage chemical waste mud churned\\nup from river bottoms where it had been rotting for a century the\\nbrown smear lay over twothirds of hebertown and there was something\\nworse at its center a long streak scores of yards to either side of\\nthe river it seemed almost to have been bulldozed clean\\n\\nthe river still boiled many feet above its normal height and flotsam\\nrolled past dotting its swell there were tree trunks chicken houses\\ntimber and swollen things you didnt want to guess at the bridges were\\nout the stout pwa bridge and the two rickety county bridges\\n\\nchesbro studied the view gramatan mills are wrecked he said\\ntheyll never come back they rebuilt on the river in ninetyseven\\nright where the old waterpower mill was half their plantstorn away\\n\\nlets get on down groff said\\n\\nmccue volunteered id try the schoolif its standing thats where\\nyou always set up cots and aid stations\\n\\nchesbro said the junior highs standing built well on the outskirts\\nlucky its on this side of the river\\n\\nthey started down the hill the stink grew worse\\n\\nfirst they came to frame houses with picket fences and vegetable\\ngardens in the back the porches were full exhausted people looked\\ndully at them at the third or fourth house a man came to his gate to\\nwatch them pass\\n\\ngroff said weve got your burgess here he seems to have pneumonia\\ncan we make him comfortable in your place and get a doctor for him\\n\\nthe man said tiredly theres no room in my place i have twentyfive\\nthirty people and the doctors wont make house calls not today all\\nthree of em are down at the school take him there\\n\\nmrs goudeket said could you maybe put me up mister weve been\\nwalking and walking\\n\\nno room he said im full up everybodys full up go to the\\nschool they got stretchers there the air force dropped em in the\\nathletic field i hope henry gets better go down to the school\\ntheyll take care of you there\\n\\nfor ten dollars maybe mrs goudeket began\\n\\nmoneys no good the man said his voice began to rise hysterically\\nnothings no good i work at the gramatan mills and look at it i\\nworked there twentyseven years i was going to get my pension in \\nand now the mills gone my father drove down into town before it hit\\nto see if he could help and he isnt back yet and i dont know if hes\\nalive or dead he took sudden hold of himself i have to go and tend\\nthe cookstove you have to boil your water now thirty people drink a\\nlot of water we keep boiling it all the time take care of henry he\\nwent back up his path and inside\\n\\npast the rustic houses on the fringe they came to a belt of substantial\\nolder places the homes of the borough petty aristocracy here the\\nsmear of brown had reached the horses picked their way uncertainly\\nfetlockdeep in stinking mud a madeyed woman in a housecoat was on\\none of the handsome porches shoveling and shoveling the silt plopped\\ninto the silt that covered her lawn\\n\\nthey passed a house with a broken back a towering poplar surely the\\npride of the owner once had stood in his front yard the flood water\\nhad come it had loosened the soil to the consistency of porridge\\nthe tree had tilted a little leaned its wide shallow root system\\nhad given way and the trunk had crashed across the roof caving and\\ncrumpling it in\\n\\nthere was a house with black dead eyes somehow fire had started\\ncandles or a fireplace carelessly laid for warmth when the\\nelectrically fanned oil heater clicked silent the innards of the house\\nhad burned and the fireman had not come there was a pathetic pile of\\nfurniture outside but where the people were you couldnt tell\\n\\nthere was a house that in all that chaotic destruction had survived\\nunscathed its windows had their glass its doors were neatly locked\\nthere were two spindly iron chairs on the porch and then you looked\\nand saw that it rested in the middle of a road where the water had let\\nit drop\\n\\nbut it was the smell that hurt you could imagine a hurt town mending\\nitself and growing again but this stench from the river bottoms was\\nthe stink of death ill bet said artie chesbro with a dreamers\\neyes you could pick up any mortgage in town for five cents on the\\ndollar today\\n\\n                                   \\n\\ndr soames was the towns only specialist he had built a white\\ngeorgian house and a threecar garage out of something less than a\\nquarter of a cubic foot of the human female anatomy he was an expert\\non every fold and canal from the _labium minus_ to the hydatid of\\nmorgagni and of the hundred and four babies born in the borough of\\nhebertown and surrounding territory in the past twelve months he\\nhad delivered ninetythree they told scandalous anecdotes about his\\nextraofficial lifemrs hoglund hoglund oh i didnt recognize\\nyou with your pants upand there had been a suggestion at the county\\nmedical association that some of his most profitable pregnancies\\nwere not permitted to come to term but there was no human being in\\nhebertown and environs who doubted that dr soames was the greatest\\ndoctor on earth\\n\\nand what good was he doing now he demanded silently swabbing alcohol\\non the mornings twentyfifth rump to ready it for the needle\\n\\nhe sighed and jabbed home the needle of yellowish fluid the kid jumped\\nand howled dr soamess hand was not as dexterous with injections as\\nit might once have been they were working themselves into a coma all\\nthree of the doctors with routine shots against typhoid and penicillin\\nto keep the sniffles of the kids from getting worse but any ambulance\\ndriver could have done as much what these people neededhomes help\\nmoneywas not in their little black bags\\n\\ndr soames chief of police brayer was coming into the schools gym\\nthe tired old face looked worriedalmost panicked soames had thought\\nthe time for panic was over theyre bringing henry in doctor he\\nlooks bad\\n\\nthe burgess came in under clean blankets on an aluminumframe\\nstretcher at last soames took a quick look fever coma and the\\nunmistakable racking hardfought breaths pneumonia wake up doctor\\nbrandeis he ordered but he found a hypodermic and loaded it without\\nwaiting\\n\\nthe other doctors eyes were bleary when he staggered in but there\\nwasnt much doubt pneumonites all right he said auscultating\\nthe burgesss chest we ought to have oxygen frank chief brayer\\nlistened to the doctors he cut in dont we have any oxygen soames\\nshook his head and brayer remembered the oxygen was there all right\\nin the firehouse where it was handy for the pumpers to take along in\\ncase of drowning or asphyxiation or any of the other things hebertown\\ncalled out its fire department for but it wasnt handy at all in case\\nof floods since the firehouse was in the borough hall you couldnt\\neven see the roof yet though the water had gone down\\n\\nhe blundered out of the room and buttonholed one of the other\\nvolunteers whove we got who can swim underwater he demanded we\\nhave to get the oxygen out of the firehousehenry needs it\\n\\nthey found a couple of highschool kids on the swimming team and they\\nwent down to survey the drownedout hall the water had slowed enough\\nto put a boat out they rowed down front street over the back yards of\\nthe cottages into the river road must be around here brayer said\\ndoubtfully staring at the muddy water some of the houses got moved\\ni guess\\n\\nit wasnt there one of the boys eventually went down but only for a\\nmoment he came up sputtering and grunting his eyes squeezed tight\\nwhen they got him into the boat and he could talk coherently again he\\nsaid sorry mr brayer maybe theres still some of the firehouse\\ndown there but that isnt water its plain mud even if i had a face\\nmask i couldnt seeand i dont have a face mask they took him\\nback to the school to have his eyes looked after chief brayer leaned\\ndizzily against the door frame watching dr brandeis bathing the kids\\neyes what he wondered was hebertown going to be like without henry\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nmickey groff woke up they must have given me a shot of something he\\nthought clearly and sat up\\n\\na girl in a white uniform with gold bars at the collar leaned over him\\nand said you ought to go back to sleep youve only had about two\\nhours\\n\\nhe shook his head hows the old man\\n\\nwhich one\\n\\nstarkmanthe burgess but she didnt know the name groff stood\\nup and staggered to a chair what was an army nurse doing here he\\nwondered wings and a bar maybe theyd flown in help from outside\\n\\nsomebody helped him to a garage empty of cars with duckboards laid\\nover the mud on the floor there was a sort of emergency feeding\\nstation organized there and he got hot coffee laced with thick canned\\nmilk syrupy with sugar he went out in the sunshine and drank it\\ngratefully\\n\\nsunshine\\n\\nhe slowly accepted the fact that it wasnt raining any more the sky\\nwas spotty with clouds but there was a lot of blue\\n\\nmr groff he tried to get to his feet it was artie chesbros wife\\nshe stopped him\\n\\nwheres everybody he asked\\n\\nsleeping mostly except my husband who is out looking for orphans to\\nrob have you seen henry\\n\\nhe blinked henry\\n\\nthe burgess mr starkman he shook his head she said gently ive\\nbeen with him all morning if they dont get help for him soon\\n\\nhe noticed that her eyes were unaccountably filled with tears i\\nthought i saw an army nurse\\n\\nyes but they didnt have oxygen and thats what he needs its on\\nits way i guess or anyway they say it is she looked at the coffee\\nwait a minute i want some of that\\n\\nmickey groff looked after her and sighed now why was she mothering\\nthe old man and what was that orphans to rob remark it had been\\nfairly obvious that she and her husband were not cut from the same\\nbolt but was it possible for her to see her husband that clearly and\\nkeep on living with him\\n\\nhe was beginning to wonder whether he shouldnt get up and start\\nsomehow helping out when she came back and sat beside him she was\\nhumming to herself he noticed and glanced at her curiously evidently\\nshe wasnt so upset after all\\n\\ni knew she said dreamily swirling the coffee around in the mug to\\nstir it that two of us would go it is the difference between six and\\neight\\n\\nthe what\\n\\nshe laughed as if a child had done something clever i knew you\\nwerent a student of the great science she said cheerfully there\\nare perfect numbers and imperfect numbers the imperfect numbers\\nareimperfect and the worst of them are the deficient ones eight\\nis an imperfect number you see she grinned at him you think ive\\nflipped she commented\\n\\nwell i wouldnt say\\n\\nbut youd think it no matter mickeydo you mind if i call you\\nmickey im quite sanei have the advantage of you you see because i\\nhave my diploma to prove it she sipped her coffee thats what makes\\nartie so mad she said pleasantly he got me committed to the haven\\nand they kept me there for nearly a year and now when he threatens to\\ntell people im crazy i dont have to worry because six perfectly fine\\npsychiatrists agree that im not\\n\\nmickey groff said weakly thats very nice mrspolly i mean\\n\\nshe said seriously you mustnt think that the great science is one\\nof these crackpot cultist affairs i know gematry has a bad name but\\nyoud be astonished at the great minds that have worked on it fermat\\nbachetback as far as diophantos in fact why if youd justoh\\nplease mickey she touched his arm as he started to move ill stop\\nthis isnt the time to talk about important things\\n\\nimportant\\n\\nthis she said is a time for shallow surfacy affairs a time\\nwhen distractions come crowding in and cannot be ignored one such\\ndistraction is that mr starkman is dying and needs oxygen\\n\\ni have an idea he said come on\\n\\nthere was a boy of fourteen standing by with a handkerchief tied around\\nhis left arm an improvised brassard son groff said do you go to\\nthe junior high\\n\\nyes\\n\\nthe burgess mr starkman needs oxygen and they cant get at the\\nfirehouse tanks it occurred to me that there might be some in the\\nschoolthose little tanks they call lecture bottles that they use for\\ndemonstrations in chemistry classes\\n\\ni havent taken chem yet mister i dont know the boy said\\nunhappily\\n\\nare there any teachers here\\n\\nyes sir mr holtz the math teachers making the coffee back there\\n\\ngroff approached holtz a small harried man holtz listened and said\\nnot in the junior high no no lecture demonstrations just recitation\\nand lab but the senior high across the river would have some my\\ngood friend mr anderson lectures there and he believes in making it\\nspectacular yes they would have lecture flasks id guide you there\\nif i werent assigned perhaps you can find somebody\\n\\ngroff decided he would not these people were working at top capacity\\nnow he could do the job on his own\\n\\ngroff and polly picked their way through the silt to the river bank a\\nrowboat manned by two husky youngsters with the improvised brassards\\nwas unloading a weeping woman and a silent child\\n\\nget to the school one of them told her in an important basically\\nuncertain voice theyll take care of you there theyve got nurses\\nand everything\\n\\nshe walked off clutching the childs hand still weeping\\n\\nthe kids looked after her roundeyed they told groff thats mrs\\nvostek her husband drowned we just found her sitting on her porch\\ncrying maybe shes gone crazy\\n\\ncan you get us across the river we want to get into the high school\\nand look for oxygen bottles the sick cases need it\\n\\nthats what were here for mister\\n\\ngood kids\\n\\non the other bank perilously attained the kids pointed groff and\\npolly in the right direction and took aboard two grim brassarded men\\nwho carried a limp moaning girl of ten between them\\n\\nthe other side of the river was the older part of town the inevitable\\nslum had grown up there here in the streets and on the steps they saw\\ndrunken men and women with blank despair in their eyes tilting bottles\\nskyward one of them drained his bottle and yelled to hell with it\\nand hurled the empty through the plateglass window of a siltchoked\\nlittle magazineandcandy store a man not young sitting in the store\\ncame charging out with a sawedoff ball bat in his hands swinging\\nyou cheap rotten bum he yelled things arent bad enough you have\\nto make them worse\\n\\nwhile the drunk stared stupidly groff rushed between them and caught\\nthe wrists of the man with the bat easy he said for gods sake\\nyoull kill him with that thing\\n\\nthe drunk came to life let him kill he yelled whats the damn\\ndifference now no job no house no furniture let him kill but he\\nreeled off down the street while groff held the furious man\\n\\nstupid bastard the proprietor swore ill give him bottles\\nthreefifty he owes me ill give him bottles then the fight suddenly\\nevaporated out of him groff let go and they walked on looking back to\\nsee him shamble into his store again and sit down with the bat across\\nhis knees\\n\\nthey passed a bar and there was no nonsense about that two men who\\nlooked like brothers stood grimly at the door each had a shotgun over\\nhis arm when groff and polly walked by they shifted the guns a little\\nand said nothing\\n\\na corner grocery had become a sort of involuntary relief station there\\nwas a long unruly line leading to the door the grocer stood there\\nbehind him in the store his wife was bringing up canned goods bottled\\npop everything the grocer sweating and afraid was handing out the\\nfood and drink to the sullen people as they passed\\n\\nplease he was saying i havent got time to write this down please\\nremember what you take and come around and settle when things clear up\\n\\nafter a fashion he was avoiding the sack of his store\\n\\nthe high school was an old red brick building smaller than the new\\njunior high across the river groff marched up the steps and tried the\\ndoor bloody hell he said locked of course\\n\\nshe pointed theres an open window\\n\\nthey climbed in and found themselves in the principals office three\\nmen with sledge hammers and crowbars were knocking the knob off the\\nsafe they turned menacingly\\n\\ngo ahead groff shrugged i cant stop you\\n\\nget the hell out of here one of them said\\n\\nwe came to get some oxygen polly said for the sick people across\\nthe river\\n\\nsick people okay\\n\\nthey went into the corridor and wandered from room to room on the\\nsecond floor they found an oldfashioned lecture theater bowlshaped\\nwith steep rows of seats focusing on a laboratory bench piped for water\\nand gas there was a promisinglooking door behind it\\n\\nit was locked groff kicked at the door and swore with pain the\\nbuilding was oldfashioned brick and its woodwork was oldfashioned\\ngolden oak the stuff you can hardly drive a nail into he trudged down\\nto the office again the three men were gone the door of the safe\\nswung open they had left one sledge somehow he had expected to find\\nall the tools dropped but apparently they were going to work their way\\nmethodically through every safe they could find\\n\\nhe returned with the sledge and bashed at the goldenoak door until\\nits latch sprung and it swung open it was the storeroom for lecture\\nsupplies and the gas flasks were neatly stacked on the top shelf\\nthere was a complete carton of a dozen twelveinch cylinders marked\\no_ and another carton with eight cylinders\\n\\nthank god he said lets go\\n\\nthe things were horribly heavy\\n\\nas they retraced their way to the river bank they were stopped three\\ntimes by loungers collected in groups of half a dozen and had to show\\nthem the cartons contents and explain that it was for the sick people\\nacross the river\\n\\nthere was a long wait before they could hail one of the boats passing\\nback and forth finally a rowboat with a roaring outboard motor pulled\\nup two men with american legion caps manned it they explained their\\nmission and were taken aboard one of the legionnaires asked how are\\nthings in old town\\n\\nbreaking up fast groff said\\n\\nthe man understood perfectly the goons he said nodding theres\\ntalk about sending in the national guard he said meanwhile i guess\\nits our problem\\n\\nhe took the heavier carton from groff when they reached the river bank\\nand groff took pollys together they walked to the gymnasium where\\nharry starkman lay\\n\\none of the doctorsbrandeislooked at the lecture bottles dully\\ntook one and shambled over to the burgesss litter he drew the blanket\\nover starkmans face slipped the bottle under and cracked the needle\\nvalve for a few hissing minutes then checked the old mans pulse\\n\\nvery good he said at last to groff and polly theres something to\\nhope for now now clear out you two find something useful to do\\n\\ntheres going to be trouble in old town tonight groff said and it\\nmay spill over here\\n\\npolly preoccupied said the number is still imperfect two of us\\nwill have to go i do hope it wont be you mickey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            \\n\\n\\nthere was a solid line of cars bumper to bumper on the northbound\\nside of the highway it ended against a roadblock consisting of\\ntwo state troopers one standing in the middle of the lane with a\\ndoublebarreled shotgun over his arm the other by the roadside where\\nhe could look into the cars their patrol car was pulled over on the\\nsoggy shoulder its motor idling\\n\\na new lincoln with a middleaged man at the wheel was next\\n\\nwhy do you want to get through mister the trooper demanded he\\nhad long ago given up the timeconsuming request for registration and\\noperators permit\\n\\nthe man was flustered i have some friends in newtown he said i\\nthought maybe there was something i could do for them\\n\\nthe trooper glanced into the back of the car empty you havent got\\nanything they need he said turn around and go home\\n\\nmeekly the man uturned around the trooper in the road and sped south\\n\\nthe next car was a tired topdown convertible with two young couples\\nwho might have been highschool seniors college freshmen or young\\nworking stiffs the driver explained too glibly indicating the girl\\nby his side her mother lives in bradley so she got me to drive her\\nin you know the railroads and buses arent running officer\\n\\nbut the girl giggled\\n\\nwhere does she live in bradley asked the trooper the girl hesitated\\nand took a deep breath before beginning to lie the trooper gave a\\nweary shushing gesture skip it he said turn around and go home\\nthis is no circus\\n\\nthe driver began to bluster ive got a license i can drive where i\\nwant\\n\\nturn around and go home the trooper said if you keep arguing ill\\nrun you in for obstructing traffic if youre stupid enough to proceed\\ndown that road schultz there will fire one warning shot and will then\\nblow your goddam head off move\\n\\nthe boy roared his motor spitefully to say the things he didnt dare\\nsay let up suddenly on his clutch and spun around the patrolman with\\nthe shotgun in a uturn\\n\\nthe next car was black and driven by a man in black its rear and the\\nseat beside the driver were filled with cartons the trunk lid was\\nhalfup tied by a rope to the bumper over more cartons\\n\\nim from the beaver run meeting of the society of friends the man\\nsaid quietly weve gathered some things they may need in there\\nmedicine bandages sterno flashlights\\n\\nthe trooper hesitated were supposed to accept contributions and turn\\nyou back then a truck comes and takes them in but i havent seen any\\ntruck and i dont know whether theres going to be one or if it was\\njust talk you look as if you can take care of yourself mister go on\\nin and dont get hurt he called to the trooper in the road let him\\nthrough\\n\\nthank you said the quaker and drove on at a careful thirtyfive\\nmiles per hour\\n\\ndown the southbound lane the deserted left strip of the highway a big\\ncar purred slowing obediently to a stop at the outraged shout of the\\ntrooper the old man who was driving said nothing the young woman with\\nhim put out her head and called dr buloff factoryville new york\\nare there any instructions\\n\\nthe trooper backed around the car and read the new york plates the\\nsecond two characters were md he said to the old man just go in and\\nfreelance doc they can use you\\n\\nthank you officer the old man said with a good trace of german\\naccent and the car purred on\\n\\nin rapid succession three imbeciles followed the doctors example of\\nusing the southbound lane all were sightseers and all were turned\\nback with curses\\n\\nthe next car in line was a  ford driven by a whitefaced young man\\nwith the jitters and a narrow mustache he had identification papers\\nready in his sweating hand john c barshay he said precisely as\\nyou can see from the address on this envelope i live at  olney\\nstreet newtown i work in new york city and come home weekends my\\nwifei havent been able to get through on the phone his voice was\\nrising hysterically i demand to be let through officer\\n\\ncalm down the trooper said gently of course you can get through\\nwere not here to stop people like you i hope everythings all right\\n\\nthe young man fought his way back to composure thank you officer\\nhe said precisely and drove on\\n\\nthen there was a phenomenon a car coming _from_ the flooded area it\\nwas coming fast until the driver presumably could see that the hassle\\nup ahead was a roadblock and then it stopped and began to wheel around\\n\\nhold em schultzie the trooper yelled at his partner with the\\nshotgun he leaped into the idling patrol car spun its wheels for an\\ninstant in the soft shoulder and then zoomed free down the highway the\\nother car had barely finished its turn he had it crowded off the road\\nin seconds he got out with his gun drawn and a casual bead on the head\\nof the unshaven slackjawed man in the drivers seat get out with\\nyour hands up he said his body shielded behind the front of his car\\n\\nthe driver got out dulleyed\\n\\nturn around\\n\\nhe did and the trooper frisked him there were things in his pockets\\nnone of them gunsize the trooper from behind pulled out watches a\\ncostly new spinning reel and some rhinestone rings and necklaces\\n\\nthe back of the car was filled with new suits and dresses some\\ncrumpled and mudstained the trooper lifted the trunk lid and found\\nshiny new appliancesa pressurecooker a steam iron a handsome floor\\nfan a sandwich grill a rotisserie\\n\\nis this car yours the trooper asked interestedly\\n\\nno the man mumbled\\n\\nyoull be sorry for this days work boy the trooper promised keep\\nyour back turned\\n\\nhe rolled up the windows took the car keys from the ignition and\\nlocked it up with the man beside him he drove back to the roadblock\\nand prodded him out with his gun\\n\\nlooter he said to his partner stolen car locked up down there\\nfull of plunder watch him to the man he said stand over there and\\ndont try to run or youll get killed now whos next\\n\\npress said a jaunty young man in a convertible showing a card\\nquickly\\n\\ndo that again the officer requested reluctantly the young man did\\nthe officer read aloud the zeidler news service requests that police\\nand fire officials extend all press courtesies to its representative\\ngeorge e neumann he grinned back to pittsburgh mr george e\\nneumann\\n\\nthe young man shrugged and wheeled his car around\\n\\nthe next two cars were or appeared to be driven by legitimate\\nrelatives of people in the flood area at least they were filled with\\nsensible supplies the trooper passed them the next was a yearold\\ndodge sedan with an oldish driver and a youngish passenger haggarty\\nthe driver said new york _daily globe_ this is vince ruffino my\\nphotographer the press card it was a little green folder with\\npicturean embossed city seal through itthumbprint description and\\nthe signature of the police commissioner fire badge said haggarty\\nflipping open a leather folder okay\\n\\nokay the trooper said and waved them on\\n\\nthe line of waiting cars was beginning to break up the number of\\npeople turned back and the sour replies they had called as they passed\\nthose still in line explained it\\n\\nanother vehicle coming away from the flood area fast it had a\\ncardboard sign with a red cross on it stuck in the windshield a\\nstation wagon full\\n\\nthe trooper at the checkpoint paused to watch the driver of the\\nstation wagon stopped by the trooper with the shotgun spoke to him for\\na minute nodded and slid into gear again the trooper at the check\\npoint stared at the faces inside the station wagon some drawn some\\nnervously exuberant as it went past\\n\\nthe trooper with the shotgun was walking down the road toward him\\ntransients he said theyre getting them out\\n\\nthe other trooper said hesitantly diddid you ask\\n\\nyeah they havent found anybody answering your wifes description\\nnot that the driver knew about anyway shell be all right\\n\\nsure thanks the trooper with the shotgun turned and walked back\\nhis partner sighed and moved on to the car at the head of the line it\\nwas stretched out of sight again\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nyou want me to stop for any of this\\n\\nthe photographer said nope ill wait until we get in the town but\\njeez its pretty beat up isnt it\\n\\njay haggarty nodded and concentrated on his driving one of the beatup\\nelements of the landscape was the road they were on water had scoured\\ngravel out from under the surfacing in places and there were potholes\\nwater had rushed across the road in a flood in other places and left\\nmud and debris\\n\\na man in a leather windbreaker yelled at them to slow down and\\nhaggarty obediently put his foot on the brake he followed the\\nmans instructions and they crawled across what had recently been a\\nfourmilliondollar tollbridge it seemed to be vibrating as they\\ncrossed it haggarty had to remind himself that they wouldnt have been\\nallowed on it if it werent safe the river was within two feet of the\\nsurface of the roadway and there was an uneven thudding as flotsam\\nrammed into the accumulated tangle on the upstream side\\n\\nthey passed between the empty toll booths and headed for hebertown\\n\\nhaggarty said i was here just before the war vince nice quiet\\nlittle town it doesnt look as if its been built up much since then\\n\\nruffino said who the hell would want to build a house around here\\nyou wake up some morning and youre under water give me passaic\\n\\nthere was a second roadblock just before the sign that said\\nentering hebertown haggarty showed his card and leaned out\\nof the window to ask where the emergency relief headquarters was the\\ndirections turned out to be pretty complicated its straight down\\ncenter street only you cant get through theretrees across the\\nroad so turn left on maple but you wont be able to take the bridge\\nat white street because its blocked off go three blocks further and\\ncross on the highway bridge then youll have to watch out for soft\\npavement on locust\\n\\nruffino said unbelievingly jeez jay its worse here than it was\\ndown by the river do you mean that little creek had enough water in it\\nto do all this he stared at the little gray stream that flowed under\\nthe highway bridge and at the twisted halfcollapsed warehouses and\\nstorefronts that were easily five feet above water level\\n\\nits the little streams that do the damage haggarty told him once\\nthe water gets into the rivers its all right it can flow away but\\nyou see how close these buildings are set to the creek here as soon\\nas the water came up a couple of feet it clobbered them\\n\\nhe stopped because the photographer was opening the door of the parked\\ncar and no longer listening it was as good a place to get started as\\nany haggarty pulled over to the curb locked the ignition and got out\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            \\n\\n\\nmrs goudeket caught up with polly and groff so long i slept she\\nsaid panting they wouldnt wake me up hows mr starkman\\n\\nthey think hell be all right for a while anyway said mickey groff\\ntheres a whole field hospital coming in somebody said if he holds\\nout until then hes got a good chance\\n\\nthank god said mrs goudeket beaming and mr chesbro\\n\\npolly chesbro said cheerfully i havent seen him all day\\n\\nmrs goudeket looked at her appraisingly all she said was i guess\\nhes pretty busy\\n\\nmickey groff coughed uh the diner up the hill is in business mrs\\ngoudeket we were just about to go up and get something to eat would\\nyou like to come along\\n\\nwhy not then i got to find a car to get back to the hotel imagine\\nshe laughed one hundred and sixty guests and the only one there to\\nkeep an eye on them is dave wax believe me goudekets green acres\\nis one place theyll never come back to again she was very gay\\nabout it groff thought if you didnt look too closely he had a\\nsudden picture in his mind of what the last twentyfour hours meant\\nto goudekets green acres and to mrs goudeket herself one hundred\\nand sixty guests at say five dollars per day per head over eight\\nhundred dollars a day and out of that you could pay for the putting\\ngreen and the swimming pool pay the salaries of the cooks trumpet\\nplayer and chambermaids and busboys pay the installments on the\\nmortgage and the electric bill and squeeze out a profit enough to\\nkeep you for a year on what you made in a summer but although your\\none hundred and sixty guests could cancel themselves out overnight\\nreservations or no reservations you couldnt cancel the trumpet player\\nor the mortgage or the putting green\\n\\nthey had to wait in line but they finally got a booth in the diner\\nthe menu was soup sandwiches and stewapparently slapped together in\\na hurry out of what would otherwise have spoiled in the refrigerator\\nthere still was no power evidently the diner was operating its stoves\\non bottled gas\\n\\nbut it tasted good to all three of them outside the diner again with\\ncoffee in cartons for groff and polly chesbro for them to drink at\\ntheir leisure mrs goudeket said listen what are you going to do\\nnow you still have business here mickey\\n\\ngroff shrugged thats what i came up for but i doubt i can do\\nanything about it today\\n\\nso stay overnight at goudekets green acres she said hospitably\\n\\nyou think we can get back there\\n\\nmust be somebody with a car i can pay\\n\\ngroff looked around there were a lot of cars and not many of them\\nwere going as he watched a big sedan chugging down the road with a\\nload of dirtyfaced children coughed and stopped a man in a legion\\ncap redeyed and bearded got out and wearily opened the door for the\\nkids they apathetically began to trudge down the hill to the temporary\\nhospital\\n\\nout of gas groff said theyre all running out of gas\\n\\nand then one car that was not out of gas a lowslung sports job came\\nrocketing along the road took a turn too fast and skidded on the\\nmudslick street its fishtail swerved left into a fire hydrant with\\na crash that made the dishes behind the diner counter rattle on the\\nrebound the cars remaining energy sent it nosing to the right through\\nthe plate window of a clothing store by then it was burning fiercely\\nfrom the tail two figures dark in the glare of burning gas spilled\\nfrantically from the bucket seats and flailed their way through the\\nsmoke and jagged glass\\n\\ncome on groff yelled a general invitation to perhaps half a dozen\\nweary redeyed men standing about with coffee cartons of their own\\nthey ran for the smoky blaze it beat fiercely against groffs forehead\\nand cheeks he found himself almost racing crazily into the flames\\nbefore he stopped groff peered into the holocaust and saw nothing\\n\\na man tugged his arm drawing him back a couple of yards the man said\\npreoccupied that was ed von lutzs little car a porsche eds got a\\ngarage he had that thing for advertising\\n\\ngroff said watching two people die whys he racing it around town\\n\\noh that wasnt ed the man told him ed got killed in his\\ngarage hours ago water undermined the sills and footing he was in\\nthere trying to straighten up and then the floor gave way and his\\naircompressor storage tank rolled over him that wasnt ed that must\\nof been some crazy kid thats been hanging around thinking about the\\nlittle sports car ever since he got it in and he thought this was his\\nchance for a free ride i guess that was his girl with him\\n\\nthe quick fierce gasoline flame was burning itself out now the blaze\\nhad passed to the clothes on display the fixtures the shelves the\\nbuilding was a long brick row not battered by the worst of the current\\nbut horribly soiled the clothing store was the central one of seven\\nshops there were apartments upstairs\\n\\nlets get the burning stuff out before it spreads groff said grimly\\nhe walked into the smoke and holding his breath came out with a\\nsmoldering armful of suits off a rack he dumped them in the gutter\\nwhere they charred and stank\\n\\naxes a man sighed hardware store around the corner\\n\\nill get em shouted mrs goudeket trotting off save the mans\\nstock dont let the fire spread\\n\\nthe next half hour was a nightmare of chopping and prying at burning\\nwood dashing out for smokefree air when you had got a little ahead of\\nthe flames groff burned his left forearm when he brushed once against\\nthe stillblistering frame of the car midway through the job somebody\\ncovered the two charred figures from the car with a pair of topcoats\\neach and they carried them out and laid them on the curb later they\\nwere gone somebody groff never knew who had taken them to the\\ntemporary morgue in the me church basement\\n\\nhe woke once from his daze of chopping and prying to find polly chesbro\\npulling on him theyre stealing everything mickey she said\\ninsistently cant you stop them\\n\\ngroff looked around the store was gutted the fire only an evil\\nsmoulder here and there he coughed and walked out sidling around the\\ntwisted blackened little car with the bashedin tail he breathed\\nfresh air outside to his surprise it was late afternoon\\n\\nthe pile of clothes from the store was dwindling before his eyes\\npeople were picking it over and grabbing mrs goudeket was screaming\\nat them leave the mans stock alone illill she took an axe\\nand made a feeble pass at a man in mechanics coveralls he shoved\\nher hard and sent her sprawling polly chesbro began to curse the man\\nfluently he ignored her as if she were a buzzing fly groff went and\\npicked up the gasping old woman you hurt he asked\\n\\nshe rubbed her behind and shook her head glaring murderously\\nloafers she said bums without brains to run a business themselves\\nlook at them\\n\\ngroff looked at them from the wrong side of the tracksriver in this\\ntown sick neurotic faces shrill neurotic voices as they squabbled\\nover tidbits like carrion crows feeble slum types most of them\\nbut a few of the gorillas that every slum produces in defiance of\\nmalnutrition men women and gorillas there were about a dozen of\\nthem this was his cue to deliver a ringing oration on the rights of\\nproperty and shame them away from the only chance most of them would\\never have at an eightyfive dollar suit or topcoat\\n\\nhe took up mrs goudekets axe and walked purposefully toward the\\ncarrion crows break it up he yelled hoarsely if you cant do\\nanything useful you can go home and not make any more trouble\\n\\nthe gorilla who had shoved mrs goudeket looked at him appraisingly\\npicked up the bundle of clothes he had neatly laid aside and walked off\\nwith them in his arms there was a nice charcoalgray singlebreasted\\nsuit on top\\n\\nput those down groff snarled the man just kept walking there was\\na crackle of laughter from the others around the pile where were the\\ndecent people groff wondered angrily they were on the fringes and\\nthey were waiting their world was balanced on a razors edge and they\\ndared not breathe let it tip one way and looting would tilt again to\\nlaw and order let it tip the other and looting would tilt over into\\nmurder\\n\\ngroff balanced the doubledbitted axe in his right hand and hurled it\\nat the departing gorilla it flew like an arrow its flat top thudded\\ninto the small of the mans back he fell howling on the soft bundle\\nof clothes he embraced groff walked up to him and rolled him over with\\nhis foot the man cursed him and groff drew back his foot for a kick at\\nhis bullet head the man stopped instantly glaring go home groff\\ntold him\\n\\nthe decent people on the fringes had come to life they cried to the\\ncarrion crows go home leave the mans stock where it is get back\\nwhere you belong\\n\\nand it worked because it was still daylight\\n\\non the way back to the school the ghq of the town groff and polly\\nchesbro and mrs goudeket saw again the ruin and the despair and\\nsomething new hatred a couple railed at a man standing on his porch\\nthat he had plenty of room that they had to have a place to sleep\\nthey _knew_ he had plenty of roombut the man grinned hatred at them\\nand calmly shook his head\\n\\nthat said polly chesbro in a low voice could be the paying off\\nof an ancient score the couple in the mud could be mr and mrs town\\nbanker suddenly poor because they havent a bed and the man on the\\nporch could be the village bum owes everybody in town brink of\\nfinancial disaster but suddenly rich because he has a bed this is the\\nday of jubilee groff the day of leveling\\n\\nthey passed a house canted off its foundations they saw a man calmly\\nbuilding a rubbish fire against one corner of it and almost went on\\nso natural did it seem his eyes were bright when he looked up and he\\nseemed only a little offended when they kicked his fire apart\\n\\nits the insurance he explained twelve thousand dollars fire with\\nextended coverage you know what itll cost me to get this straightened\\nup rent a crane a big gang of men with hydraulic jacks a weeks\\nwork easing the house back on the footings and then everything will\\nbe sprung the whole housell have to be replastered five thousand\\ndollars easy and i havent got it so i figured were covered for\\nfire make a clean start the kids are grown now and we dont need a\\nplace this size of the adjoining houses he had not thought at all\\n\\nthey walked him down to the school he chattered volubly all the way\\nquite unhinged polly efficiently vanished in search of a doctor with\\na needleful of morphine and eventually she led one of the army medics\\ntoward them\\n\\nthe arsonist snapped to and said crisply sir these civilians tried\\nto prevent me from carrying out my mission if you ask me theyre\\nkrauts\\n\\nthe medic led him away protesting\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nartie chesbro said worriedly sharon are you sure akslunds coming\\nhere none of these dopes seem to know anything\\n\\nsharon froman said positive this is the only road in from the north\\nhell have to stop at the check point even if he is a congressman\\nshe paused added the captain who told me was the detachment\\ncommunications officer he got it right off the radio himself she\\ngave chesbro a smile of good fellowship it never hurt to remind a man\\nhow helpful you were being\\n\\nchesbro sighed im getting tired of waiting here all the same these\\ntinhorn heroes are getting under my skin the next idiot that wants to\\nknow if ill help out with the salvage squads or let them take this car\\nfor emergency duty gets a tireiron across the face\\n\\nsharon said sympathetically youd think theyd know enough to leave\\nyou alone wouldnt you there was a siren scream from down the road\\nand they both sat up straight to look but it was only an ambulance it\\nslowed briefly at the roadblock the troopers waved it by and it sped\\naway\\n\\nsharon took out a cigarette and pressed the dashboard lighter then\\nshe remembered it didnt work and lit the cigarette with a match it\\nwasnt much of a car they were in but it was the best car chesbro had\\nbeen able to rent for what money he had in his pocket and naturally he\\nwouldnt have been able to do it by himself she thought comfortably\\nshe was the one who had learned that representative akslund was coming\\ninto the disaster area on an inspection tour she was the one who had\\nlocated the car and she was the one who had put the idea in chesbros\\nhead of meeting the congressman and riding with him nicely done\\nsharon she told herself and the best part of all was that she had\\nsucceeded in making him think it was his own idea\\n\\ni wonder how pollys making out chesbro said\\n\\nsharon permitted herself a frown her face turned away she said\\ngaily probably loving every minute of it arthur it must be pretty\\nexciting for her anyway she added blandly mickey groffs probably\\ntaking good care of her\\n\\nmickey groff he looked at her with surprise polly\\n\\nsharon said well he _did_ seem rather interested\\n\\nchesbro shook his head oh no you dont know polly believe me men\\narent her he hesitated and said believe me she has too much\\nsense to get involved with a twobit operator like him shes loyal\\nsharon absolutely loyal to me he was silent for a moment and then\\nwithout looking at the girl he said pollys a funny kid she isnt\\nuh _normal_ if you know what i mean like youd think a wife would\\nbebut shes loyal absolutely\\n\\nsharon froman took a deep quiet breath ahha mr chesbro she\\nthought to herself with satisfaction the wife isnt quite normal\\neh somehow or other she doesnt respond when you get that urge and\\nthe years go by and then you notice that you arent getting the urge\\nas oftenas far as shes concerned at any rate so after a while you\\ndont even worry when shes off with another man\\n\\nsharon nodded wisely to herself just the way it had been with hesch\\nand his first wife shed made a man out of hesch even if he had\\nfinally let her down and she could make a man out of this unpromising\\nlout too\\n\\nthe unpromising lout sat up sharply hey he yelled somethings\\ncoming its got a statepolice escort maybe its akslund\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthe congressman was on the best of terms with the air forcepossibly\\nbecause he held appointments on three appropriations committees\\nthe air force had been delighted to fly him up from washington that\\nmorning and had been eager to fly him right into the disaster area in\\na helicopter but representative akslund himself had put his foot down\\nabout that transport planes were one thing helicopters were something\\nelse so the last fifteen miles of his trip were in a car furnished\\nthrough the courtesy of the state police\\n\\nunbelievable he murmuredbut enunciating every syllable crisply and\\nclearly it looks as if a war had been fought over every inch of this\\nlovely countryside i estimate the damage i have already seen is in the\\nmillions out of the corner of his eye he observed that the ap man\\nwho had tagged along wasnt writing anything down disappointing but\\nakslund was too old a hand to try to hint about it the ap man would be\\nwith him for a good many hours yet there was plenty of time for direct\\nquotes\\n\\nthe police car ahead sounded its siren the congressman craned his neck\\n\\nroad block the driver explained theyll pass us right through\\nsir\\n\\nbut they didnt the driver of the car ahead stuck out his arm and\\nsemaphored a stop the congressmans chauffeur braked sharp and smooth\\nand stopped a yard away from the other cars bumper\\n\\na state trooper on point duty walked over and said sorry to hold you\\nup sir you can pass of course but theres a man here who says he\\n\\nartie chesbro appeared panting he stuck his hand in the open window\\ngood to see you again halmer he said im artie chesbro state\\ndelegation perhaps you remember our little chat at the waldorf last\\nyearthe fund dinner\\n\\nrepresentative akslund opened the matchless filing case in his head\\nand riffled through the cards he remembered glad to see you again\\nchesbro are you in this mess\\n\\nup to my eyebrows from the very start there were eight of us trapped\\nin a building all night long one was killed by gasoline fumes\\nanothers in the hospital with pneumonia this minute but thats not\\nthe point ive been thinking heavily about relief and reconstruction\\nhalmer and ive developed some ideas id like to share with you mind\\nif i come along\\n\\nrepresentative akslund noticed that the ap man was scribbling at last\\neight trapped all night one dead one dying this chesbro knew what\\nhe was talking about his interests were mediumbig and diversified\\nsaid the _chesbro_ card in akslunds head hed be able to give him the\\nsound businessmans viewpoint akslund knew he had to move fast the\\nfirst public figure to hit the headlines and newscasts with a formal\\nplan would skim the publicity cream how to be a statesmanhumanitarian\\nin one easy lesson chesbro would save him time\\n\\nget in he told artie\\n\\nroom for my assistant miss froman artie asked\\n\\nof course chesbro i need facts and i need them fast\\n\\nartie waved the comeon to sharon in the car on the shoulder\\n\\nshe reached into the back of the car for her manuscript briefcase and\\ngaily ran for the limousine she didnt even bother to lock up the car\\nwhich artie had rented with a solemn promise that hed return it to the\\ngarage in exactly two hours it would get back to the man somehow she\\nthought contentedly big things were happening now no time for trivia\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthe ap man leaned forward and asked chesbro\\n\\nright arthur chesbro of summit i own a piece of the hebertown\\nnewspaper i have some real estate im interested in broadcasting\\nthirtynine years old\\n\\nveteran\\n\\nah i was a consultant to the war manpower commission i wasnt\\nactually in the service\\n\\nwhos the man who died\\n\\nsam zehedi zehedi i think it goes a grocer about thirty\\nwe were holed up in a filling station on state highway  just two\\ncarloads of people who couldnt get through the flood the sick man\\nis im sorry to say my very dear friend henry starkman the burgess\\nof hebertown in the morning when we realized he had pneumonia we\\ncarried him about twelve miles into town hes in that improvised\\nhospital they have there when i saw him last his condition was poor\\nhe is about sixtyfive he was in my car when we got stopped we were\\nlooking at conditions and making plans on a small scale what mr\\nakslund is here for cue to sharon\\n\\nsharon said to the congressman the networks are probably trying to\\nget mobile broadcasting units in right now they should be set up and\\nsending by midnight by morning theyll have all they need to lead the\\ndisaster strong in the breakfast newscasts\\n\\nit was a reminder that they had better get down to brass tacks on a\\nconcrete proposal for relief and reconstruction dramatically issued\\nfrom the site of the flood it would be unbeatable\\n\\nthey were rolling slowly into hebertown proper\\n\\nartie said to the driver drive around for a while\\n\\nyes said akslund show me everything\\n\\nsharon added drop me off at the school ill get the police chief to\\nfind a room for us somehow well have work to do\\n\\nlots of it akslund said thoughtfully looking through the window at\\nthe wreckage\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nno cars\\n\\nmrs goudeket rubbed her forehead thoughtfully she had tried two\\ngarages and no cars for rent chief brayer they said he had\\n_commandeered_ them if you please had them driven to a motor pool\\nthe couple of cars going through the streets that she had flagged down\\nwere on missions see chief brayer\\n\\nwell she would see this new dictator this hitler of hebertown she\\nreached the schoolhouse and there sure enough was the motor pool\\nin the teachers parking lot across the streeta strange collection\\nof vehicles ranging from a twoton farm truck to somebodys little\\nrambler there was a man with a clipboard at a table on guard\\n\\nshe sniffed and walked into the marble lobby of the school which\\nwas crowded and noisy with the talk of fifty busy people there were\\ntwo uniformed men at card tables one was in a firemans queer boxy\\nuniform cap and the other must be this brayer\\n\\nhe was talking to a boy scoutat a time like thisbut she waited\\nuntil he was finished then she burst out ive got to have a car im\\nmrs s goudeket of goudekets green acres ive got to get back to my\\nplace now\\n\\nthe mustached old man looked up sorry maam he said we need all\\nthe cars for public service maybe later after some help comes in why\\ndont you\\n\\ndid you hear who i am she yelled\\n\\ni dont give a damn who you are he yelled back standing up the\\ntown is drowning people are sick people are looting and burning\\nwere trying to hold it together for a few hours until help comes\\ndont come here grabbing for a car go and find something useful to do\\nthey need help in the hospital people to make beds and carry slops\\nyou can do that or if you dont want to do that you can at least get\\nout of everybodys way\\n\\nhe sat down and turned to a man wearing a handkerchief around his arm\\nand immediately was in thoughtful intense conversation with him\\n\\nmrs goudeket recoiled a step then walked slowly from the lobby\\n\\nmaybemaybe he was right there was polly waiting for her\\n\\nshe said to the girl no cars we should go work in the hospital they\\nset up for a while polly they need help\\n\\npolly chesbro nodded together they walked to the improvised excuse for\\na hospital\\n\\nmrs goudeket was thinking mr goudeket wouldnt have stormed up to\\nthat busy old man he would have seen that making beds in the hospital\\nright now is more important than whether green acres is in the black\\nthis year mr goudeket may have been right about more things than i\\never knew before\\n\\nshe wondered idly how the orange groves in palestine for which they had\\ndonated year after year were growing\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nten minutes later sharon was at the desk telling chief brayer youve\\ngot to hes the head of three committees he can turn the faucet and a\\nmillion five million dollars runs into hebertown or he can leave the\\nfaucet shut think of your town chief\\n\\nbrayer sighed and wished henry were there at last he beckoned to one\\nof the deputies and said take two men go to the new fielding place\\nthat little ranchhouse thing on sullivan turn everybody out we need\\nit for congressman akslund and his uh staff leave a man there to see\\nthat nobody sneaks back in better leave a man there as long as the\\ncongressmans there for a guard and in case there are any messages\\n\\nthanks chief sharon said warmly youre doing the right thing\\nill just wait here theyll pick me up and can you let us have a\\nguide to show us the way to the house\\n\\nsure said brayer god it must be smooth to be a congressman\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthey had dropped off the ap man and artie could talk freely another\\nthing i didnt want to say in front of him halmer is the southern\\nangle those democrats from dixie are going to be swarming around\\nthe valley offering sites and tax writeoffs and hell knows what to\\npersuade damaged industries to relocate this means you build up the\\ndemocratic south and drain strength out of our state unemployment and\\ndiscontent were gop here but not by such a margin that a sharp\\nlocal depression couldnt put the state over the line the cities\\nfrankly we lost last time but we have the counties as of now if the\\nvalley isnt saved halmer it might cost us a senatorand you know\\nwhat that would mean knocking off bolling and his sixteen years of\\nseniority and the committee appointments that go with it would be a\\nvery serious thing for us nationally im not exaggerating when i say\\nthat a large prompt injection of cash is vital to everything you and

read it jotted down a figure on\\nher clipboard and said holding his own excuse me she shook down\\nthe thermometer popped it into a glass that held many thermometers\\npicked out another one and slipped it under the tongue of the person\\nin the next litter a girl of ten with a dry burning face and dry\\nburning eyes\\n\\nin the marble lobby of the schoolhouse mickey groff was studying an\\nextraordinary organization that had sprung up within a very few hours\\ncard tables had been set up and conference tables dragged from offices\\nand classrooms for an adhoc government with the wires out you wanted\\neverything under one roof in one room instead of scattered through a\\ntown hall when a man came to you with trouble you could fix this way\\nthere was no phone to pick up this way you called across the room and\\nthings happened fast\\n\\nthere were two main centers around the fire chief and the police chief\\nthey retained roughly their old jurisdictions respectively over the\\ndestructiveness of nature and the cussedness of man while groff\\nwatched a woman came coolly to the fire chief in her turn to say that\\nher undermined house was beginning to sag and she had twenty refugees\\nthey had gone out into the street could he find places for them and\\nas an afterthought could they do anything about the house the fire\\nchief called to three boy scouts part of his combined field force and\\nhousing records one knew a big thirteenroom place on the outskirts\\nwhich when he last checked had only twelve people in it thirteen\\nrooms space for twenty more and the house\\n\\ngeorge the fire chief called to a brassarded man get some people\\na dozen if you can and see if you can do anything about mrs comdens\\nplace she says its beginning to lean badly be a pity to see it go\\nnow\\n\\ngeorge an electriccompany rigger said what kind of a house mrs\\ncomden how big which ways it going\\n\\nframe twostory eight rooms its going into the street maybe gone\\nby now i dont know\\n\\nwhats in the back yard do you have a back yard\\n\\nshe passed her hand vaguely across her forehead brushing back her\\nhair back yard just a back yard a vegetable garden\\n\\ngood said george with satisfaction i know where theres some wire\\nrope and oil drums well dig in the drums for deadmen and anchor the\\nhouse to them with the rope ill need a truck chief\\n\\nyou get a car the chief said sorry he scribbled a note which\\nwould go to the guardian of the improvised motor pool outside george\\nwalked off with it slowly collecting waiting men he picked them\\nbig and burly the woman trailed apathetically after the chief was\\nalready engaged with a man who wanted a gang to clear away snapped\\nand fallen electrical cables which would set his house afireand as\\nan afterthought the neighborhood it was inthe instant current came\\nthrough again he got two men with axes and a felling saw to cut away\\nthe fallen tree that had brought down the cables\\n\\nit was getting dim in the marble lobby in spite of the tall windows\\non a couple of the card tables candles stuck in their own wax were\\nbeing lit across the room somebody was pumping up a coleman lamp it\\nlit in a dazzling greenwhite flare and the gloom was gone for a\\nwhile\\n\\non the police chiefs side the reports were more bitter goons from\\nacross the river red so far theyre just hanging around and talking\\nit up but theyve got bottles its just a matter of time before they\\nget brave enough to smash my window and grab the furs theres a dozen\\nof them and ive got to have at least six men so help me if i dont\\nget six men im going to kill the first drunken sob that makes a\\nmove at our place ive got my brother there with the shotgun now\\n\\nskip the rest

i havent seen you in town before\\n\\nmickey groff from new york i came in to see your burgess about\\ntaking over the old swanscomb mill for a factory of mine\\n\\ngroff henry talked about your offer

do put up your hand\\n\\ngroff did\\n\\nin a rapid mumble the old man asked him whether he swore to uphold and\\ndefend the laws and constitution of the state of pennsylvania so help\\nhim god groff said he would and the old man said he hereby appointed\\nhim a special deputy policeman of the borough of hebertown and he\\nadded i sure hope this is legal because ive been doing it all day\\nsign your name on this list clarence give this man a thirtyeight\\nhave you got a handkerchief mister no clarence give the man a clean\\nhandkerchief to tie around his arm\\n\\nhe clanked down an enormous revolver and five cartridges on the table\\n\\nfive groff asked\\n\\narmy the chief snorted the chamber under the hammer is kept empty\\nin civilian life groff let me see you load it\\n\\nfishing in his memory groff broke the revolver set the safety loaded\\nit and closed it being very careful where he pointed the thing\\n\\nthe chief said i guess i wont have to take it back after all now\\nyou stick around and wait talk to murphy over there hes been a\\ndeputy before this\\n\\nmurphy was small and quiet he volunteered that he was a plumber and\\nthat thered be a lot of work for him after all this was over he\\nshowed groff how to carry his pistol in the waistband of his pants\\nand said cautioningly of course we aint going to use them you\\nunderstand\\n\\ngroff who had his doubts about it said he understood and watched\\nwhile a batteryoperated receivertransmitter on another of the card\\ntables came to life under the ministrations of a sixteenyearold boy\\nthe fire chief and the police chief both charged over so after a while\\ndid a doctor from the outside when the word reached him the three\\ntried simultaneously to dictate messages to the bulldozed teenager\\n\\nthe fire chief wanted chemical trucks sent in as many as could be\\nrounded up the police chief wanted national guardsmen at least a\\nbattalion the doctor wanted to know where the hell the goddam army\\nfield hospital was it was an interesting fight and mickey groff was\\nsorry when a trouble call came in and he and murphy missed the end of\\nit\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthe man in the legion cap said you best give me that gun fella i\\ncan handle it\\n\\nso can i said mickey groff he wasnt nasty about it but the man in\\nthe legion cap shrugged and let it go this the place groff asked as\\nthe car stopped\\n\\nthis is the place the legionnaire scowled worriedly they took all\\nthe boats across the river you see anything over there\\n\\ngroff got out of the car and looked it was full dark now and the\\nriver was wide there were lights of some kind on the opposite bank\\nbut he couldnt have told you what they were flashlights and electric\\nlanterns most likely\\n\\nbut they looked a little bit close\\n\\ngroff ordered turn the car to the right put the brights on the\\nlegionnaire cramped the wheels around and inched forward he kicked the\\nbutton of the highwaybeam headlights\\n\\ntheyre coming all right said groff shapes were lying on the\\nwater punctuated with hand lights\\n\\nsons of bitches said the legionnaire bitterly now therell be hell\\nto pay four of us against every goddam goon on the riverand harry\\nand me aint even got guns\\n\\ntake it easy walt murphy said but in the reflection from the\\nheadlights groff could see his face was worried\\n\\nmurphy who had appointed himself in charge of the detail sent the\\nlegionnaire named walt after the legionnaire named harry and he\\ndisposed them as best he could groff got the place of honorhe had\\na gun he was put on the end of a little loading jetty murphy took a\\nposition on a floating landing platform walt and harry were left to\\nstand by the car to keep the lights on the boats\\n\\nand the boats came on four of them putputting through the water in\\nconvoy formation funny thought groff abstractedly if i were them\\nid come ashore upstream a little way this is the natural place for\\ndeputies to be waiting for them if they used their heads theyd know\\nthat and theyd come ashore somewhere else\\n\\nhe thanked his lucky stars that the goons evidently were not using\\ntheir heads\\n\\nharry behind the wheel of the car was making a fantastic amount\\nof racket grinding gears racing the motor shifting back and forth\\nto pick out one boat after another with the headlights damn fool\\nthought groff aggrievedly he could hardly hear the deputy named murphy\\nshouting at the approaching boats there was some kind of answer from\\nthem but he couldnt make that out at all\\n\\nbut they were getting close\\n\\ngroff carefully dropped to one knee rested his hand with the revolver\\nin it on the railing of the jetty and took aim at the lead boat how\\nlong had it been since hed fired the pistoldismounted qualifying\\nrange nearly fifteen years he guessed it was in the first few\\nmonths of basic training and always after that it had been a carbine\\nor an m\\n\\nsomebody was coming up behind him\\n\\ngood god he thought theyve made another landing he started to turn\\n\\nit was the man walt grabbing for the gun leggo you he panted\\nclutching at the revolver if youre too yellow to shoot let me have\\nit\\n\\nwalt was no kid he was in his late fifties at the least but he was\\nbig and solid and groff was off balance for a moment he staggered at\\nthe end of the jetty walt leaning on him\\n\\nthey both went in\\n\\nthe water was cold and the current was fast what became of the\\nrevolver groff didnt know he broke surface spluttering and choking\\n\\nwalt was splashing right beside him help me he bawled for gods\\nsake help me i cant swim\\n\\ngroff had one bitter moment of temptationlet him drown cried his\\nsubconscious but then the decision was out of his hands walt flailed\\ntoward him and caught him groff went under choking he struggled\\nupward carrying the panicky man with him got a breath went under\\nagain\\n\\nthe next time he came to the surface someone was there to grab him\\n\\nthe goons instinctively he tried to fight free but somebody in the\\nboat had a good grip on his arm they hauled him in and another boat\\nhad walt\\n\\nyou all right one of the men in the boat demanded anxiously groff\\nsaid dizzily sure but\\n\\ntake it easy said the man in the boat well take you up to the\\nemergency center we figured you peopled need some help so after we\\ngot things under control on our side we came on over he said proudly\\nthey thought i was nuts keeping after everybody to join the civil\\ndefense squads i guess theyll change their minds now\\n\\nchief brayer was looking a little ashamed of himself but he recovered\\nquickly all the men from the other side of the river had guns all of\\nthem were personally vouched for by the civil defense man they made\\nvaluable reinforcements for the exhausted deputies brayer had been\\nswearing in\\n\\nthey found dry clothes for groff and brayer put him in charge of the\\ndispatchers desk to give him a chance to warm up it had turned windy\\nwith nightfall\\n\\nthere was a commotion outside and a couple of state troopers came in\\ngroff looked past them there was a dignifiedlooking old man somebody\\nof importance by the way the troopers stood by him\\n\\nand with him were artie chesbro and sharon froman\\n\\ngroff stood up to get a better look chesbro glanced around the room\\ncaught groffs eye looked away gave him a fishy smile spoke to the\\ndignifiedlooking old man and shepherded him out of the room along\\nwith chief brayer and a couple of other top men\\n\\nsomething didnt smell good groff called another deputy over and asked\\nhim to take care of the desk he walked over to one of the troopers and\\nsaid whos that you came in with\\n\\nthe trooper said congressman akslund thats the old guy the other\\nfellows some kind of local big shot i guess you ought to know him\\nbetter than me\\n\\nlocal big shot\\n\\nmickey groff looked thoughtfully at the door chesbro and the\\ncongressman and the village elders had gone out through\\n\\nback at the filling station the night zehedi had died what was sharon\\nfroman selling chesbro a big regional organization to fight back\\nagainst the inroads of the south you and me mr chesbro\\n\\nyou and meand congressman akslund it looked like\\n\\nmickey groff shook his head halfenraged halfadmiring you had to\\nhand it to chesbro he always kept his eye on the ball\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                           \\n\\n\\nby midnight the united states army was working one of its accustomed\\nmiracles\\n\\nit involved a number of things starting with a phone call at noon from\\nthe white house to fort lowder new jersey a major general

some\\ncalls and then he and the cg finished their lunch serenely the calls\\nwhipped fort lowder to a froth of activity that looked senseless at\\nfirst an engineer officer took off like a bat out of

quartermaster battalion of\\ntwoandahalfton sixbysix trucks ordnance mechanics of the\\ndivisions heavy maintenance company swarmed like maggots around a\\ndozen redlined vehicles under orders to get them rolling at any cost\\nwarehouses were skillfully looted of parts by ordnance sergeants while\\nordnance lieutenants engaged guards in casual conversations that ended\\nwhen they got the high sign that all was well and the cause of all\\nthe activity the nd fieldhospital battalion which had almost\\nforgotten that it _was_ a fieldhospital battalion got the pitch by\\nearly afternoon long broken up into their trainingcamp formation\\nscattered through dispensaries and the base hospital they were\\nabruptly reminded of their battle mission by an announcement over the\\nbase pa system by the division surgeon their commander\\n\\nwonderingly the six hundred officers and men formed on the parade\\nground many still in hospital whites they were young md first\\nlieutenants grinding out their drafted service wearily they were\\nmale rns with their big perennial bitch that they were lucky to\\nget a rocker while a woman of equal training automatically got a gold\\nbar they were corporals

interested\\nin the problems and possibilities of their work on the parade ground\\nthe division surgeon reminded them of something it was that they were\\ntrained to move into a given bare field and turn it in two hours into\\na functioning fivehundredbed hospital\\n\\nthey dispersed to almostforgotten warehouses where they broke out\\nfield medical chests of instruments and medicine they found again\\nthe long coiled snakes of green treated canvas tons of it the \\nlitters and the thousand tent pegs big and small and the jointed\\ntent poles and the miles of rope each piece in its place and the\\nsledges to drive the pegs and the coleman lanterns to hang on the\\npoles the trucks of the quartermaster battalion backed up and the tiny\\nhandful of fieldgrade officers buzzed everywhere yelling and cajoling\\nand consulting loading lists and trucks were unloaded and reloaded a\\ndozen times in some cases to get the right load in its right place in\\nthe line of convoy\\n\\nthe engineers had finished an overlay strip map of the route by then\\nand mimeographs began to spin out copies for the quartermaster drivers\\nan mp platoon moved out in a truck and one man was dropped at each\\ntricky intersection to wave the convoy through each mp had a couple of\\nkrations with him because hed be busy long into the night as the\\nconvoy went past the rearmost men theyd be picked up in the truck and\\nleapfrogged ahead of the foremost men to the next tricky intersections\\n\\nthe water trucks went as a matter of course but it took a flash of\\ngenius for somebody to realize that the area would be short of gas and\\nthis got the infantry into it a puzzled rifle company found itself\\nyanked off the firing range and assigned to the mysterious chore of\\nfilling fivegallon jerry cans with gas from the pumps of the division\\nmotor pool and stacking them solid in three sixbysixes\\n\\nit took a flash of west point tradition for the division band to be\\nmassed at the camp gate when the nd rolled off shortly before\\nsunset the division commander was there the band oompahed and\\nhe impassively took the salute from the startled doctors in the\\ncommand cars a few of the enlisted men of the battalion rolling past\\nremembered vaguely about crossing the arms and sitting at attention\\nthere wasnt a man there who was not though theyd hoot at the word\\ninspired by the ancient tradition of the field music and the ancient\\ngreeting they were exchanging with the tough old pro who was sending\\nthem on their way\\n\\nthey rolled for six hours until their tailbones were bruised and\\ntheir bladders ready to burst along highway and detour and miserable\\nblacktop it was dark soon but the sound of some of the bridges they\\nrumbled over scared them silly krations and canteen water staved off\\nthe boredom and so did banter when they crept through the towns\\n\\nthey arrived eventually at the field the engineer officer had spotted\\nfrom his division plane and stiffly went about turning the field into a\\nfivehundredbed hospital it took cursing and coaxing and five men\\nutterly out of condition doubled up clutching at brandnew hernias\\nwhile they manhandled the tons of canvas and pegs and poles another\\nwas doping off in the dark and a truck backed over him killing him\\nthe casualty rate for the operation was one per cent which was not bad\\n\\nwhile the tents rose in the headlights glare the officers in their\\njeeps and command cars were spreading out to the stricken communities\\none of them found hebertown two miles away\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthe young lieutenant for a few hours not wearily grinding through\\nhis period of drafted service said to chief brayer were prepared\\nto take over your entire

new\\nlieutenant talking crisply to an exhausted nurse\\n\\nthat one she said he isnt tired\\n\\npolly said wanly thats nice she wasnt listening particularly\\nshed come to the hospital in the first place to keep an eye on the\\nburgess but he was off in an upper room what they humorously called\\nthe quiet ward because there was in fact fractionally less noise\\nand confusion there than on the lower level she hadnt seen him for\\nhours\\n\\nmrs goudeket insisted look darling theres another one maybe\\nanother ambulance came in\\n\\nthats nice said polly escaping they were moving two of the\\npatients again and it was her sector of the floor the patients were\\ncarried off in littersnew green ones polly noticed wearily maybe\\nthere was another ambulance in strip the cots bundle the

any new patient not for either of the beds\\n\\ntwo pinkfaced kids in clean green fatigues brushed by her and set a\\nlitter down next to the bed with the elevenyearold boy in it polly\\nstarted to

staggered into the\\nimprovised dormitory and passed out his last before that had been\\nbreakfast on cheese crackers in the gas station his stomach was\\nactively growling\\n\\nhe headed for a dim door stumbling over litters and bundles of\\npersonal possessions he was cursed a couple of times\\n\\nthe dark corridor outside was lighted at its end and he emerged into\\nthe school lobby full of men with homemade armbands from somewhere\\ncame a tantalizing smell of coffee\\n\\nhe asked one of the brassarded men just coffee here the man said\\nnearest foods the diner up the hill cant miss it its lit\\n\\nand the diner did stand out like a bonfire by virtue of one pressure\\nlamp he found a cop there to keep order and a chipper waitress who\\nlooked at him grinned and set out a bowl of breakfast food crunched\\nopen a can of condensed milk with the corner of a cleaver and poured\\nthe whole can into the bowl sugar she said and shoved the\\ndispenser at him\\n\\nthanks he poured sugar on and began to spoon down the cloying\\nmixture as fast as he could\\n\\nanother the waitress asked when he was done\\n\\nhe patted his stomach experimentally i guess not he said you have\\nany coffee\\n\\ncoming up she slapped a mugful at him and he sipped it down\\n\\nbetter he said how much\\n\\nfor free she said she assumed a greek accent mr padopolous says\\namericas so good to him this is his chance to say thank you\\n\\nwell thank mr padopolous for me when he gets back\\n\\nhe walked out into the dark and bummed a cigarette from the cop after\\na deep drag he told him im a transient in town by accident\\n\\nyoure lucky the cop said sourly i live here\\n\\nyeah welli mean is there anything i can do\\n\\nthe cop shrugged not much helps getting here lots of it the army\\nrolled in a hospital and the governor sent a battalion of national\\nguards one of thems supposed to show up here and relieve me so i\\ncan get some sleep he yawned tremendously and sat down on the diner\\nsteps my advice to you get some sleep and in the morning theyll\\nhave something fixed up for you maybe those army trucksll get you\\nwhere you want to go\\n\\ndick said thanks and walked off well hed missed it slept right\\nthrough it\\n\\nthe cop called after him hey kid not toward river street the guard\\nsent a sound truck around unsafe buildings wideopen warehouses and\\nstores theyre patrolling with guns got it\\n\\ngot it said the toolate hero thanks he turned right and walked\\non hed be able to find the school again it was the only place in\\ntown maybe the only place for miles with _two_ lights in front one\\nshining through the door and the other hung to a spike in a phone pole\\noutside where the motorpool man guarded a weird collection of vehicles\\n\\nhe rambled down one dark street cursing inwardly he was sure the big\\ndynamic mickey groff hadnt slept through it had seized the chance for\\nleadership and heroism\\n\\nquite suddenly his chance arrived and he almost walked right past it\\ntwo writhing figures in a doorway a woman and a man in a silent\\ndeadly struggle he had one arm around her head and his paw over her\\nmouth her dress was torn down the front\\n\\nit flashed through his head he was about to defend the virtue of\\na maiden against the assault of a lustmaddened drinkcrazed human\\nbeast chivalry stuff\\n\\nhe grabbed the mans shoulder and heaved but his heart wasnt in it\\n\\na fist flailed from nowhere and smashed him high on the right\\ncheek hard enough to make an icy area of numbness for a moment and\\nthenhells own pain from that moment his heart was in it while the\\nwoman shoved aside lay on the ground panting he waded into the man\\nafter the first few blows it was no longer a fight but firstdegree\\nassault he battered the man to the ground and stood over him grimly\\nhis chest heaving you want any more he croaked\\n\\nthe man mumbled something it could have been no\\n\\nhe looked around for the woman she was reeling down the street one\\narm propping her against the wall a couple came scurrying past stared\\nat her and gave her a wide berth he hastened after her can i help\\nyou he asked\\n\\nshe said sluggishly went to see if my sister wasno jus go away\\nthanks and everything but leave me alone please\\n\\nhe backed off and watched her slowly make her way down the street she\\nturned a corner and he crossed the street to see she painfully climbed\\nthe steps of a frame house with a porch went inside and the great\\nadventure was over\\n\\nexcept for the damnable aching of his cheekbone\\n\\nin hollywood he thought sourly it would have been just the beginning\\nthe boy and the girl meet cute and you take it from there in real life\\nyou save them from rape and they dont want to have anything to do with\\nyou she was probably embarrassed horribly so and wanted no part of\\nanybody who had seen her with her dress torn about to be violated\\n\\nas he walked he constructed a facesaving fantasy about another maiden\\nwho might be less preoccupied and more grateful but it was uphill\\nwork his cheek was very bad and it occurred to him that it might be\\nmore than a bruise people did get fractures there also he seemed to\\nhave broken a knuckle\\n\\nthe hero business didnt pay very well\\n\\nhe turned around and headed back for the school maybe he could find a\\ndoctor there to take a look at his face he was by then almost sure he\\ncould feel bones grating when he worked his jaw\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nit was a panel truck like any other panel truck you might see except\\nfor the name on the side and the thirtymeter whip antenna sticking up\\nfrom the roof it parked out in front of the schoolhouse and mickey\\ngroff stepped outside to see what was going on _federal broadcasting\\nsystem mobile unit four_ he read one of the men in the front seat\\nwore headphones was talking into a hand microphone\\n\\nit was nearly two oclock in the morning hell of a fat audience\\ntheyll have to listen to them now thought groff it didnt occur to\\nhim that all over the country listeners were staying up past their\\nbedtimes for just such eyewitness onthespot accounts as this\\n\\nchief brayer came out and said you still here get some sleep\\n\\nit was good advice for the chief too groff thought he was too old\\na man for this sort of carryingon the national guardsmen had taken\\nover the problems of patrolling the floodedout burnedout areas and\\nmost of the temporary deputies had turned in their guns and armbands\\nbut groff wasnt sleepy he was tired deadsick tired but he wasnt\\nsleepy\\n\\nhe said chief what was artie chesbro doing with the congressman\\n\\nbrayer rubbed his chin i forgot you and him were competitors he\\nsaid almost apologetically\\n\\nkeep on forgetting it said groff that isnt why im asking\\n\\nbrayer looked at him thoughtfully and shrugged you think chesbros\\nhorning in on something maybe youre right hes thick as thieves with\\nold akslund all right and id swear they never saw each other before\\ntoday the congressmans all hotted up about a regional disasterrelief\\nagency hes been sending out statements and messagesright through\\nour own radio i read some of them one of them went right to the white\\nhouse boy hes asking for a billion dollars grant\\n\\nand i suppose artie chesbro wants to have something to say about\\nspending it\\n\\nthe chief said slowly wouldnt you\\n\\nno said groff suddenly hot whats the matter with you brayer\\nyou know this chesbrostarkman knows him hes a cheap angleshooting\\ncounty politician not even your own county for gods sake i came\\nup here to start a factorymaybe not a very big factory compared to\\nford or rca but the biggest damned factory i ever tried to start\\nand chesbro was in on the ground floor ahead of me trying to steal my\\nfactory site for some twobit deal of his own you think he cares about\\nhebertown you think hes going to worry about whether the right people\\nget the right money or whether the area makes a recovery from this he\\ncares about artie chesbro and thats all\\n\\nnow hold on a minute boy\\n\\nhold on hell if henry starkman wasnt halfdead he wouldnt let\\nchesbro get away with this what right have you got to\\n\\nhold on boy the old man was suddenly erect forceful you dont\\nhave to tell me what henry likes and doesnt like fortyone years\\nweve been friends and between us we pretty near run this town and\\nyou know whats been happening every year a couple more buildings off\\nthe tax rolls every year another couple thousand dollars short in\\ncollections chesbro sure boy hes out for number one but i saw\\nthat message that went to the white house it said a billion dollars\\ngod mando you know what any part of a billion dollars would mean to\\nhebertown\\n\\nhe glared at groff without speaking for a moment then he leaned back\\nand rubbed his eyes wearily a billion dollars he said and it was\\nlike a prayer\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthe little ranch house had been perfectly untouched by the flood it\\nwas well uphill on sullivan street representative akslund worked\\ncomfortably through the day in the pinepaneled den his work consisted\\nmostly of conversation with artie chesbro while sharon sat by and took\\nnotes by candlelight agreement was reached a statement was signed\\nthe old man yawned politely and shuffled off to the master bedroom\\nyou release this to the network he said from the door the wire\\nservices can take it off the air good night\\n\\nand sharon and chesbro raced to the school\\n\\ndamn it said chesbro peevishly the mobile broadcasting truck was\\ngone they scurried around with flashlights sharon found a state\\ntrooper who thought he remembered seeing it heading down toward the\\nropedoff area at the foot of river street the houses there were\\neither down or abandoned and the only permitted persons were national\\nguardsmen theoretically patrolling against looters\\n\\nhello said mickey groff sharon froman jumped and turned around\\n\\nshe said projecting throatily mickey thank heaven its good to see\\nyou mickey we were worried\\n\\nartie chesbro caught her eye and slid away sharon said gaily hasnt\\nthis been a day we havent slept ten minutes altogether since we saw\\nyou last luckily im a writer she lifted her briefcase with a smile\\n\\nwhats that got to do with it\\n\\nwe writers have our little secrets she said she put her hand on his\\nshoulder strolling him away\\n\\nwhered chesbro go\\n\\nhell be back sharon assured him buy me a cup of coffee and tell\\nme whats been going on\\n\\nbuying a cup of coffee consisted of rinsing out a cup and ladling\\nblack coffee out of the tarry stew that had been bubbling over a\\ngasoline flame for six hours groff let himself be steered and took a\\nsip of the coffee it was awful but it was coffee he said ive been\\nhelping out around here as best i could so has chesbros wife and so\\nhas mrs goudeket and you\\n\\nsharon said with a quiet pride weve been doing our share believe\\nme weve spent the whole day with congressman akslund he just went to\\nbed a few minutes ago\\n\\nalone mickey groff asked\\n\\nsharon looked at him with cold resentment thats an unpleasant\\nremark groff she said thinly if thats the way you intend to talk\\nill leave you alone she turned her back on him and walked haughtily\\naway\\n\\nanyway artie chesbro was already out of sight there was no chance\\nthat groff could find him before he reached the mobile unit\\n\\npoor mickey groff thought sharon with deep and sincere sympathy he\\nwould take it hard when he heard chesbro had congressman akslunds\\nbacking to head the emergency relief committee but he had had his\\nchance he had seen her first but he had chosen to throw in his lot\\nwith mrs goudeket and that fantastic chesbro woman and she had gone\\nover to the better man\\n\\npoor mickey groff sharon thought comfortably maybe some other\\ntime\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            \\n\\n\\nmrs goudeket tottered into the marble lobby of the schoolhouse a\\nflaring pressure lamp threw grotesque shadows against the polished\\nwalls and the room was almost empty some men dozed over their card\\ntables and desks outside the last of the ambulancefitted sixbysixes\\nwas rolling noisily away with the last of the casualties\\n\\nchief brayers head snapped up from a nodding doze as she cleared her\\nthroat\\n\\nchief mrs goudeket said timidly just a few hours since i asked\\nbut i think things have changed a lot hah\\n\\nhe focused on her with difficulty and said at last oh the lady from\\nthe hotel\\n\\ngoudekets green acres she said automatically with pride i was\\nthinking that now maybe things are more under control hah so maybe\\nyou could spare me a car some gas i have to get back look over my\\nproperty if it still is my property the thought came unwelcome\\n\\na car\\n\\nmrs goudeket was exasperated you heard a car look if it makes you\\nfeel better i could take some

dick\\n\\nhe sneered experimentally i guess so he yawned and that did hurt\\nbut not too much i thought maybe it was a broken bone but it just\\nhurts on the skin now ill live he was feeling pretty cheerful the\\ndisappointing parts of his rout of the drunken beast were dropping out\\nof his recollection he said did you get the car mrs g\\n\\nof course she said surprised why not things have quieted down\\nthey have time for a reasonable request from an important local\\nbusiness proprietor he looked at her sharply but there was no\\nexpression on her face for the first time it occurred to dick mccue\\nthat here was a woman not so very smart not so very young capable of\\nbeing wrong capable of having foolish hopes she thought she was still\\nan important local business proprietor a ramshackle summer hotel they\\nfolded by the hundreds year after year it didnt take a flood to put\\nthem out of business the flood was only the mercy bullet through the\\nblindfold after the man was

it was\\ndirected not at herself but at something inside the old lady polly\\nsaid perceptively dont worry mrs goudeket everything always works\\nout\\n\\nthe old lady was crying dick mccue stared in wonder as polly chesbro\\nput her arms around the woman and protected her from the harsh\\nsurrounding world\\n\\nafter a moment mrs goudeket pushed herself away sniffing you have\\na kleenex she inquired embarrassed i dont know what got into me\\npolly please you have to excuse\\n\\ntheres nothing to excuse said polly chesbro were all worn out\\n\\nno not worn out tired yes sick maybe mrs

herself\\nbut all she said out loud was well yes or no\\n\\nartie chesbro said cheerfully thats very nice of you mrs goudeket\\ni think id better stay in hebertown thoughsome important things to\\ntake care of theres a radio truck around somewhere and i want to\\n\\nsharon interrupted loudly with a warning look mr chesbro means\\ncongressman akslund has left him some work to do anyway

and put it down on the table next to dick mccue mickey\\ngroff said wait a minute mrs goudeket what are these big things\\n\\nchesbro laughed groff does macys tell gimbels i tell you what\\nyou want the swanscomb place right he shrugged generously its\\nyours i wont buck you\\n\\nif you wont buck me its because you dont want it any more groff\\nsaid youre after bigger game what would that be chesbro a finger\\nin a billiondollar pie a chance to spread federal funds around the\\nway you want to maybe the break youve been waiting for\\n\\nchesbro said fretfully now mickey _please_ why cant you be\\nreasonable youre an outlander here youve got nothing to do with the\\ncommunity you want to move in with your nickel factory go ahead i\\nwont stand in your way ill even help you but you cant do anything\\nwith the federal grants because you dont have the connections\\nbecause you dont have the information about who needs what because\\nyou arent local and wouldnt be allowed to come within smelling\\ndistance of it in the first place why not live and let live\\n\\nhe was open and honest groff sawas open and honest as the likes of\\nartie chesbro ever knew how to be you work your side of the street\\nhe was saying and ill work mine under the ethical stands of artie\\nchesbro he had made an honorable proposal it would never have occurred\\nto him to entertain propositions like\\n\\nfederal funds are money in trust\\n\\na time of catastrophe is not a time to feather ones nest\\n\\nor even\\n\\na businessman who opposes what you want to do is not necessarily a\\njealous rival\\n\\nthere simply was no handle groff thought by which you could get\\nhold of the man he was completely out of touch off in a kind of a\\ndream it was almost as if he was drunk but that of course was\\nimpossibleliquor would have put him out on his feet in seconds\\n\\npolly chesbro said suddenly what did you want the radio truck for\\n\\nartie looked alarmed now honey dont you get mixed up in\\n\\nshe said artie i know how your mind works did you think if you\\ngot on the radio and told them that you and the congressman were\\nhandling relief here that would keep him from backing out did you\\nthink everybody in the country would be listeningat this time of the\\nmorningand that would make it official\\n\\ntheyre recording artie chesbro said sullenly theyre going to\\nrebroadcast in the morning i already talked to one of the men from the\\nnetwork\\n\\ndick mccue said mr chesbro its nothing to me one way or another\\nbut theres a curfew you know you cant go running around out there\\ntonight\\n\\nartie chesbros expression was petulant leave me alone will you i\\nknow what im doing\\n\\npolly chesbro folded her hands and looked at him artie dont you\\never learn her expression was gentle her voice was calmeven warm\\ngroff thought with a sudden shock that was almost jealousy remember\\nthe television station\\n\\nartie whined honey i told you a thousand times\\n\\nyou were all set to make a million dollars out of television she\\nsaid remember only you wouldnt wait for the fcc to grant the\\nlicense well start building you said and then they wont\\nhave the guts to turn us down only they did you never got that\\nconstruction permit what was it my father put up fifteen thousand\\ndollars and you lost it all remember\\n\\nhoney these people dont want to hear\\n\\nthen there was the drivein theater you only got five thousand out\\nof my father for that but that went down the drain too like all your\\nother milliondollar ideas what was it that time you figured you\\ncould buck the motionpicture projectionists union and then\\n\\nmickey groff cleared his throat and said excuse me polly youre\\nembarrassing everybody\\n\\npolly laughed gently im sorry but really i hate to see my husband\\ngo off like this again\\n\\ngroff said to chesbro like i say i dont want to butt in but\\nremember what mccue said about the curfew chesbro i happen to have\\nbeen around when the national guardsmen got their orders i wouldnt go\\nout there if i were you\\n\\nmrs goudeket said heavily thats right mr chesbro i was down by\\nthe motorpool place and theyve got guns and\\n\\nnow you just listen to me it was sharon froman her eyes flashing\\nher face a valkyrie face arthur chesbro knows what hes doing and it\\nisnt up to any of us to try to stop him you make me sick all of you\\ni spent the whole day with arthur and congressman akslund and believe\\nme the congressman knows arthur understands how to do things and if\\narthurs all right with the congressman i dont see why he shouldnt\\nbe all right with a wetbehindtheears kid dick mccues jaw dropped\\nopenor a fat old biddy mrs goudeket began to sputteror a\\nmental case polly chesbro only nodded judiciously but mickey groff\\nsat up straight and cut in\\n\\njust a minute miss froman he started but he couldnt make himself\\nheard they were all talking at once\\n\\nto sharon froman nobody paying any attention to artie chesbro at all\\n\\nby the time anyone got around to paying attention to artie he wasnt\\nthere\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nhe closed the door quietly behind him and walked out the main door\\nnodding pleasantly to the guardsman across the street to the car pool\\nit was all going so well he thought dreamily so very well he even\\nmanaged a little wry chuckle of amusement about the silly spectacle his\\nwife had made of herself that silly old business of the television\\nstation that ridiculous story about the drivein theater but he could\\nafford goodhumoredly to overlook her raking up those long dead scores\\nbecause everything was going very well indeed\\n\\ncurfew not a problem he thought with satisfaction not as long as he\\nhad been wise and clever enough to pick up mrs goudekets trip ticket\\nthe car was his nowhed just have to say mrs goudeket had sent him\\nhe wouldnt be on foot for any length of time and no one would bother\\nhim in the car with a regulation trip ticket the whole world was well\\nwithin his grasp he realized with satisfaction and joy\\n\\nand it was due at least in part to sharon froman he nodded to\\nhimself in the darkness picking his way carefully down the slippery\\nstreet she had written the official announcement of the plan for a\\ntristate emergency allocations supervisory board that he and the\\ncongressmanwith sharon fromanhad cooked up\\n\\nartie chesbro chuckled out loud why it was even sharon who had\\nbeen so resourceful about the matter of the benzedrine he had been\\npretty near passed out with fatigue early in the day even before the\\ncongressman had arrived and she had produced out of what she gaily\\ncalled her kit of writing tools the little bottle of tengrain\\ntablets that had waked him up sharpened his brain made it possible\\nfor him to work on through the endlessly exhausting day\\n\\na fine girl a great acquisition they would go far together thought\\nartie chesbro stumbling dreamily down the misty street filled with\\nthe sense of power alive with the joy of achievementcoked to the\\neyebrows\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            \\n\\n\\nmr cioni saw the man approach jauntily who he wondered can be full\\nof bounce at this hourone of the new people from the field hospital\\nbut as the man came into the cone of light from the shaded coleman\\nlantern he saw that the fellow wasnt army that he wore in fact the\\nuniform of an oldtimer who had been through the day and a half on the\\nspot the uniform was a stained and shapeless suit mudcaked shoes\\nred eyes and a growth of beard\\n\\nim mr chesbro the man said to mr cioni ive come to pick up the\\ncar allotted to mrs goudeket\\n\\nthe hotel lady she said shed be back herself\\n\\nchesbro smiled and handed over the trip ticket shes exhausted ill\\npick her up and drive\\n\\ni see its that dodge be careful\\n\\nartie almost laughed aloud at the absurdity of advice from this nobody\\nto _him_ confidant of akslund johnny on the most wonderful spot\\nimaginable\\n\\nhe drove off river street yes the broadcasters were at river street\\nhe turned left and heard faintly a shout from the little nobody of the\\nmotor pool\\n\\na fragment of the rubaiyatnow _there_ was a poem not like those\\njumbled things polly wrotedrifted by _would we not shatter it\\nto bits and then remold it closer to the hearts desire_ which\\nwas exactly what was going to happen he had never really had a big\\nchance before but by waiting and building and sending out his lines\\nof communication he had survived until the big chance came along the\\ncounty was shattered to bits and he would remold it it wouldnt look\\nlike much to an outsiderakslund to akslund and his staff he would\\nseem a disinterested and patriotic businessman working his guts out\\nwith no hope of personal gain to reconstruct the smitten area\\n\\nhe had better start thinking about his lists\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nthe five walked into the motor pool mrs goudeket stared blankly\\nat the empty space where the dodge had been she said to mr cioni\\nhopefully you moved it into the street\\n\\nmr cioni looked sick guy had your trip ticket he said\\nmrcheese\\n\\nchesbro dick mccue said rat bastard chesbro to be exact\\n\\njust resourceful grinned sharon froman hell be back lets\\nwait he just wants to get the statement out to the country times\\nimportant you know hes got to hit the morning papers and newscasts\\nand i she thought comfortably pointed that out to him the boys\\ngeared to a countryweekly tempo but hes got talent all the same\\n\\nmrs goudeket said something long eloquent and heartfelt in yiddish\\ngroff the new yorker got the gist it was a prayer that artie chesbro\\ndie of cholera upsidedown with his head stuck in the ground like a\\nradish and worms eating out his ears\\n\\n                                   \\n\\nhis lists there would be two of them one of people to get the nod and\\nthe other of people to get the nix\\n\\na sound businessman and a hard worker that boy built his place\\nup from nothing guts and brains the kind of man we want to help\\nfirstfast i know his stock and his turnover and id say fifty\\nthousand would set him on his feet again of course hes the kind\\nwholl consider it a debt of honor wont rest until its clear\\n\\nand the other um yes know the man well weve got to help him of\\ncourse but i wouldnt put him at the top of the list the _vital_\\nservices have got to be restored first of course i know people need\\nshoes gasoline bread hardware but its my feeling that a more\\nefficient man should be assisted first we dont want any free riders\\nand we dont want to subsidize chaotic competition in the first month\\n\\nno indeed we want to organize the area a nod to flaherty the fuel\\nman whose note i hold a nix to greenlease the hardware man who\\nunpatriotically carries his current obligations and improvement loans\\nin philadelphia a nod to erpco feed who buy their sacks from my very\\ngood friend and associate don rider who is under my thumb because of\\nhis lease a nix to fowling the appliance wholesaler who wont use my\\ntrucks when hes in my territory a man who doesnt encourage local\\nbusiness is asking for trouble and this is his chance to get it an\\nemphatic nod to rorty and his skinny new wholesaling business in a\\nyear hell pass fowling and ill be in the drivers seat\\n\\nturn nobody down he cautioned himself merely postpone and postpone\\nand postpone and eventually there will be no more money left and the\\nnixed will find themselves in a poor competitive position and a little\\nlater theyll find theyre broke and out of business and the people in\\nbusiness will be my men\\n\\ni will have approximately one hundred operations tied to me covering\\nevery phase of manufacturing real estate wholesaling retailing\\ndistribution and finance in the area ill trade with myself supply\\nmyself transport myself and finance myself and anybody who tries to\\nmove in will never know what hit him it will be positively pathetic if\\nanybody tries to compete with artie chesbro\\n\\nthe car crept slowly along the littered road toward river street his\\nthinking had never been so clear and lightningfastand his heart had\\nnever thudded so alarmingly the benzedrine he supposed well you use\\nthings for what theyre worth and take the incidental consequences like\\na man\\n\\na big man first the valley area perhaps a year to consolidate\\nit then move down and upriver slowly at first but he knew the\\npace always accelerated the bigger you get the faster you grow\\nrockefeller morgan zeckendorf odlumthey all had started somewhere\\nthis was his somewhere artie chesbro considered quietly that hed be\\nrunning the state by  if there was a war knock a year off the\\ntimetable wars were good

human tree luther g bayswater was\\nwalking slowly down river street with a feeling of intense unreality\\nenveloping him\\n\\nit seemed frightfully queer that he should have a helmet on his head\\nheavy boots with twobuckle flaps on his feet and around his waist\\na full cartridge belt with a firstaid kit a bayonet and a canteen\\nhitched to it queerest of all was the rifle slung on his right\\nshoulder whose sling he held in the fork between thumb and forefinger\\nlike a hick eternally about to snap his gallus\\n\\nluther was a private in the national guard because his mother had a\\nconfused notion that this would keep him from overseas service ever\\nsomebody had told her so she missed her little boy she said when he\\nwas away on summer training and she didnt like the idea of him going\\nthrough the dark streetsso late and in strange neighborhoodsfor\\nhis armory sessions but she comfortably reported that it was all\\nworthwhile for her to have her peace of mind about luther not having to\\ngo overseas\\n\\nhis mother was at that moment in bed with a high fever induced by the\\nphone call from the company clerk that had mobilized luther\\n\\nhis missionunrealas given him by the hardware merchant who was his\\nplatoon leader was to cover two blocks of river street like a cop on a\\nbeat\\n\\nit isnt interior guard duty the lieutenant explained none of\\nthat haltadvanceofficerofthedaypostnumberfour stuff just make\\nlike a cop and dont let any monkeybusiness happen fire a warning\\nshot if you have to and ah the lieutenant was embarrassed if\\nyou have to uh shoot _at_ anybody aim for the legs any questions\\nthere were questions a world of questions but luther wasnt sure what\\nthey were and besides the hardwarelieutenant was in a hurry to get\\nback to company where the captain was waiting for an explanation of\\nwhy the platoon sergeant had been found to have his pockets stuffed\\nwith halfpint liquor bottles\\n\\nprivate bayswater saw lights and heard a motor running and in his\\nstate of acute disbelief in what was around him stood stockstill for\\nmost of a minute staring at the vehicle it was parked at the foot of\\nwharf avenue a panel truck by and by he made out that it was a radio\\nbroadcasting truck and remembered that the lieutenant had told him it\\nwas in the area perfectly all right\\n\\nhe stayed near it it was less lonesome there until by and by private\\nbayswater became conscious of a nagging yearning for a smoke\\n\\nluther didnt smoke much because his mother had proved to him with\\ngraphs and charts and doctors reports that terrible things went on in\\nthe lungs of men who smoked cigarettes but he wanted a cigarette bad\\nand anyway there wasnt anyone around everybody in town knew that the\\nnational guard was patrolling with orders to shoot if they had to\\nnobody would be stupid enough to try anything nobody hadand hed\\nbeen on duty for nearly an hour\\n\\nhe leaned against a sagging warehousefront experimentally and it\\ndidnt sag any more than before he bounced on the steps and though\\nthey shook it didnt seem likely he would fall through he stepped\\ninside closed the door as nearly as it would go and greedily tore the\\npaper on the pack getting a cigarette out\\n\\ncupping the cigarette he looked out of an unglassed window and was\\npleased to find that he could observe the streets as well from in here\\nas from outside fantastic it was the first good chance he had had to\\nlook over the damage done to hebertown he wondered briefly about what\\nkind of people were crazy enough to build their houses in a place like\\nthis where the water could come up and do what had been done to these\\nbut luther bayswater was not much given to worry about other peoples\\ntroubles\\n\\nand besides he heard a noise\\n\\nit sounded like a door slamming car door but he could see the\\npanel truck nobody was moving there the two men were still inside\\nbusy about whatever they had to be busy about or else just waiting\\nfor daybreak and their first direct broadcast a door in one of the\\nbuildings\\n\\nmaybe luther bayswater wished he had been listening more attentively\\na door slamming in a buildingthat might be just the wind of course\\nbut if it wasnt the wind it was one of the hazy mythological figures\\ncalled looters that he was supposed to be on the lookout for\\n\\nhe swore a tepid oath ground out his cigarette and opened the door it\\nmade a frightful racket he hadnt noticed anything of the kind when he\\ncame into the building\\n\\nthe noise scared him he unslung the rifle and gripped it in the\\napproved portarms position crosswise over his chest one hand\\ncomfortingly near the trigger guard and he stepped out into the\\ninimical street\\n\\nsomebody was moving not near the radio truck but in the other\\ndirection someone who seemed to be trying to stay out of sight moving\\nin and out of the shelter of the buildings\\n\\nluther bayswater pulled the bolt of the rifle back it made a tiny\\nunmenacing soundhed hoped it would crash through the streets like\\na thunderbolt and send the terrified criminal fleeing he raised it\\nto his shoulder and called waveringly halt whos there perfectly\\nsafe there was no chance the gun would go off and make him appear an\\nidiot not as long as he didnt close the bolt\\n\\nthe figure stumbled and ducked out of sight baffled luther lowered\\nthe rifle which was wearingly heavy almost absentmindedly he shoved\\nthe bolt homestill perfectly safe still nothing that would make him\\nlook ridiculous for he knew enough to keep his finger off the trigger\\nhe cleared his throat and called again come out of there i see you\\n\\nfantastic cowboysandindians scene luther couldnt help feeling\\nembarrassed at how badly he was doing his part of it suppose the man\\ndid come out suppose he came running at him with a knife or a pistol\\nand luther was standing there flatfooted and gapmouthed trailing the\\ngun he brought the butt up to his shoulder snapped up the range\\nleaf curled his finger lightly through the trigger guardperfectly\\nperfectly safe these springfields took a good heavy tug to go offand\\nas meticulously as on any qualifying range laid the bead of the front\\nsight between the vedges of the rear just at knee level just where\\nthe man had been he waited\\n\\n                                   \\n\\ngoodhumoredly artie chesbro shrugged and parked the car he got out\\nand started to walk down the rubbly street there was no sense trying\\nto drive down here where the river had swept beams and bottles and\\ncinderblocks helterskelter across the pavement he had decided that\\nthe third time he had spotted something in his way and wildly swerved\\nthe wheel and hit something else instead he thought detachedly that\\nperhaps his reflexes were a touch overstimulated by the benzedrine\\namusing but it didnt in the least matter not when he could see\\neverything in the clear luminous light the benzedrine gave\\n\\nhe tripped over something stepped down on something else that rolled\\nand stumbled almost into one of the buildings careful he warned\\nhimself suppressing a chuckle why it was almost like getting a load\\non but without any of the disadvantages because he certainly wasnt\\nslowed down or incapacitated in the least he could feel it\\n\\nsomebody yelled at him artie chesbro paused thoughtfully to\\nlistenwhat had the man saidand became conscious of the deeper\\nlouder thudding of his heart possibly that fourth tablet had been one\\ntoo many he admitted better get this over with and rest for a while\\na touch concernedafter all he didnt want to be too exhausted for\\nthe big day tomorrowhe stepped forward to see what the man wanted\\n\\nhe ran right into something he hadnt seen it shoved him back on the\\nground brutally strong remorselessly hard damn it he thought\\ngaspingit didnt hurt though not for a moment and then it did\\nhurt very much and then neither it nor anything else ever hurt\\nagain\\n\\nthe private was sobbing i _did_ aim for the knees lieutenant he\\nwouldnt stop i _told_ him i thought he was a looter like you said\\nand i _did_ aim for the knees\\n\\nthe company commander leaned in front of the lights of the weapons\\ncarrier and crooked a finger at the lieutenant he was holding the\\nprivates m pointing to the sights the leaf was set for a hundred\\nyards the shot had been not more than twentyfive\\n\\na bullet leaving a rifle goes up before it goes down the line of sight\\nis straight the line of trajectory curves in a parabola an aim that\\nwould be deadon at a hundred yards will strike high at twentyfive\\nnot very high about as high as the difference

right lets clean up here he told the others gathered\\nround\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                           \\n\\n\\nthe skunks never coming back dick mccue said bitterly his face was\\nhurting again he wanted to lie down again in his comfortable room at\\ngoudekets green acres horror and fatigue far behind\\n\\nmrs goudeket didnt even hear she had taken her place on the one good\\nchair near the door and she was waiting for the moment when artie\\nchesbro the thief of cars should walk back inside that thought\\nmickey groff would be a moment to watch chesbro had been asking for\\nit for a long time it would be a pleasure to see the old lady taking\\nhim apart\\n\\nhe thought wrong\\n\\nthe old lady sighed and said how long now a day and a half i been\\naway from goudekets green acres and all the time i been worried sick\\nyou know something now im not worried\\n\\nmickey groff said thats right mrs goudeket theres nothing to\\nworry about everythings all right there youll

proudly onlywhy didnt i do it\\nwhile mr goudeket was still alive\\n\\na light truck banged past the schoolhouse down toward the river\\nand almost immediately another followed dick mccue said curiously\\nsomething going on i _thought_ i heard shooting\\n\\ntheres plenty going on dicky sharon froman informed him kindly\\nthings are very busy around here tonight but you wouldnt understand\\n\\nno one paid any attention to her after a moment she laughed and lit a\\ncigarette clods she thought with gentle contempt naturally they were\\njealous of her and of artie chesbro there were two kinds of people\\none kind was the doersherself that is and along with her such other\\npersons as she temporarily dragged along to heights of accomplishment\\nand success the other kind was everybody else not even her worst\\nenemy she mused trickling smoke out of her nostrilsnot even hesch\\nor paul or bert or any of the others she had temporarily blessed\\nwith her help and presence before withdrawingnot any of them could\\ndeny that she had moved fast and successfully this day\\n\\npolly chesbro got up and crossed over to mickey groff may i have one\\nof _your_ cigarettes she asked\\n\\nsure groff lit it for her\\n\\nshe said what are you going to do now mickey after things clear up\\na little i mean\\n\\nhe hesitated the question had not occurred to him for some time go\\nahead as planned i guess chief brayer said the swanscomb place wasnt\\ndamaged and your husband seems to have given up the idea of making a\\nwarehouse out of it\\n\\nshe laughed not maliciously i wonder if he remembers that he signed\\na lease on it she said\\n\\nlease\\n\\nshe nodded there were a couple of men from ohio in to see him last\\nweek he drew up a lease on the spot and they paid him a binder\\n\\ngroff said hell well that was pretty stupid of him but if its a\\nmatter of gettinghimin trouble i suppose i could find some other\\n\\nget artie in trouble small chance mickey he lands on his feet\\nand if he doesnt he always has the family money to bail him outmy\\nfamily that is what you really mean is youd back out in order to do\\nme a favor isnt it dont answer it wouldnt be a favor mickey i\\ndecided a long time ago that i couldnt mother artie i had to let him\\nget in his own scrapes and get out by himself if he could get out it\\nhasnt made a man of him yet but theres always the chance it may\\n\\nshe tipped the ash of her cigarette neatly into a thick china saucer\\nstay around mickey she said all of us need people like you around\\nhere for much more than business\\n\\na quality in her voice touched him deeper perhaps than she had\\nintended deeper than he could remember being touched before\\nresponsibility that was the word someone had to help and it was\\nsomething very different from ego that made him think too someone has\\nto lead\\n\\ndick mccue heaved himself to his feet his whole head was hurting now\\nand he was feeling savage im going to hit up the chief for another\\ntrip ticket mrs goudeket he announced half an hours long enough\\nto wait for the bfor mr chesbro\\n\\nwhy not said mrs goudeket she went with him groff could hear the\\ndiscussion clear from the cloakroom but they won their point they\\ncame back with another scribbled slip of paper and the whole party\\nheaded for the motor pooleven sharon though no one had asked her\\n\\nthere was somebody down by the motor pool\\n\\nas they drew close another little truck came up making a convoy of\\nthree of them and the driver of one of them hopped out heading\\nfor the motor pools coleman lamp the driver was a captain and\\nupset about something he said to mr cioni i understand theres a\\ntemporary morgue somewhere around here\\n\\nbasement of the methodist church cioni said absently walking over\\nto the open jeep thats at\\n\\nhe had leaned over to peer at what was huddled in the back of the jeep\\nhe crossed himself and stared at mrs goudeket heres the guy that\\ngot your car lady he called\\n\\nartie gasped polly chesbro she sped to the jeep and unbelievingly\\nlifted the head on its stiffening neck staring into the blank face\\n\\nthe captain his nerves twanging through his voice snapped please\\ndont give us any trouble lady this is no business of yours\\n\\ngroff said hes her husband\\n\\nthe officer lamely said im sorry very sorry and then\\ndefensively a warning shot was fired he didnt stop this area\\nis under full martial law and the sound truck announced it to\\neverybody he saw that she wasnt listening was staring in\\ndisbelief he got out of the jeep and lit a cigarette and waited\\n\\ngroff beckoned him to one side what happened he asked\\n\\nshot for looting the captain said brusquely he was in a ropedoff\\nprohibited area he didnt halt the kid was absolutely right\\n\\nkid asked groff the captain had told him more than he had intended\\nto and realized it now somebody panicked\\n\\nwho are you mister the captain asked\\n\\nnot a reporter ive got a factory in brooklyn i knew the man\\n\\nclose friend\\n\\nhated his guts\\n\\nthe captain was shocked and reacted with the truth as a matter of\\nfact he said in a low voice maybe it shouldnt have happened but\\nwere legally in the clear was he important\\n\\nvery but i dont think youll find anybody wholl press an\\ninvestigation\\n\\nthe captain took a deep relieved drag on his cigarette and flipped it\\naway what about his wife he asked is she going to keep this stuff\\nup\\n\\nill do what i can groff said he went over to the jeep and the\\nstaring woman\\n\\npolly he said\\n\\nshe turned and told him in a dry controlled voice im all right\\nits just so strange to think that itsover him and his bragging\\nhim and his plans him and his tramps its over i suppose you miss\\na tumor when they cut it out of you thats the way i miss him she\\nsagged against groff in a halffaint he led her to a chair where she\\nsat like a stick the captain in a businesslike way asked cioni\\njust wheres this church\\n\\ncioni told him and the jeep rolled away\\n\\nno no no sharon froman was saying faintly\\n\\nthen she smiled and said to groff girl backed the wrong horse didnt\\nshe mickey howd you like to meet congressman akslund first thing in\\nthe morning arties gone one with the martyrs but akslunds still\\ngoing to need expert advice on the reconstruction ive got an in\\nthere\\n\\nkeep it said groff and put his arm around polly\\n\\nshe turned to dick mccue her smile was becoming ghastly she said\\ngot a kind word for an old friend dick weve had some fun together\\nshall bygones be bygones\\n\\nno said dick mccue if you keep bothering me ill take out your\\nupper plate and step on it\\n\\nher hand flew to her mouth

motor pool a scared young voice\\nasked is this the place im supposed to leave the car\\n\\ni guess so mr cioni said\\n\\nthe young soldier climbed out wearily boy he said and wiped his\\nbrow im supposed to wait here until they come by on patrol and pick\\nme up\\n\\ngroff moved out of earshot of the women hear about the shooting he\\nasked quietly\\n\\nthe soldier shuddered heck im the guy that did it had no choice a\\ncop shoots if somebody runs and doesnt stop doesnt he well i was\\nsupposed to be a cop and he added defensively and illogically how\\ncould i check the sighting leaf in

chickering carter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nan old offender\\n\\n\\noh no i have not forgotten you i never forget the face of a crook\\n\\nthe speaker was nick carter his voice though somewhat under ordinary\\npitch had a subtle and ominous ring there was a threatening glint in\\nthe eyes he had fixed upon the face of the man he addressed\\n\\nit was a striking and impressive face nearly as strong and impressive\\nas that of the famous detectivebut for directly opposite reasons\\n\\nnick carters face was frank manly and wholesome\\n\\nthat at which he was gazing was pallid sinister and severe its\\ncleancut features were as hard as flint the thinlipped mouth denoted\\ncruelty and vicious determination the square jaw and aggressive chin\\nevinced firmness and bulldog tenacity the cold gray eyes had a shifty\\ngleam and glitter seen only in the eyes of what the detective had called\\nthis mana crook\\n\\nhe took up the epithet bitterly saying with a sneer\\n\\ncrook eh you cannot prove it\\n\\ni may sooner or later\\n\\nyou have triedand failed\\n\\nfailure never deters me from trying again you know the old adage\\n\\nyou succeeded only in smirching my name in giving me a bad reputation\\nit caused my friends to desert and avoid me it excluded me from the\\nclubs the reputable hotels from every desirable place that i had been\\naccustomed to frequent it has changed my life and turned it as arid as\\nthe heart of a desert i have you to thank for all thisyou carter\\n\\nyou are mistaken nick replied you have only yourself to thank for\\nit\\n\\nwe view it differently\\n\\nwhere have you been for the past two years\\n\\nnot where you tried to put me\\n\\nin sing sing\\n\\nyes\\n\\nnor have you been in new york or i should have known it\\n\\nyou would have known it too if i had been arrested\\n\\nmost likelyif arrested under your own name\\n\\nyou remember that then also\\n\\nboth the face and name of a crook stuart floyd i always remember\\nsaid nick i make it a point never to forget them\\n\\nfloyds thin lips curled again with intense scorn and bitterness\\n\\nthat epithet again said he between his teeth i have you to thank\\nfor itand repay\\n\\nah i see now why you stopped me said nick you wanted to threaten\\nme\\n\\nthey had met in madison avenue in fact the detective having left his\\nresidence only a few moments before it was about ten oclock in the\\nmorning\\n\\nthreaten you exclaimed floyd with ominous quietude there has been\\nno day or night for two years that i have not threatened you\\n\\nindeed\\n\\nhave you supposed that i forgot that my memory is less retentive than\\nyours that i have less cause than you to remember have you thought for\\na moment that i forget and forgive\\n\\nit matters very little to me floyd whether you do or not nick\\ncalmly informed him entirely unaffected by the subdued yet vicious\\nintensity with which the other was speaking\\n\\nlater carter you will pipe a different tune floyd went on with\\neyes vengefully gleaming i will not sleep until the debt is paid i am\\ngoing to put something over on you carter that will more than balance\\nour account smile scornfully if you will but wait until i plunge you\\ninto the melting pot it will cometake my word for that its you for\\nthe melting pot you for the melting pot\\n\\nnick carter did not ask him what he meantdid not seriously care nor\\ndid he attempt to detain him though he glanced after him a bit sharply\\n\\nstuart floyd had stepped to one side then walked briskly away without a\\nbackward glance and he was quickly lost to view in the throng of\\npedestrians then in the avenue\\n\\nnick carter walked on as if nothing had occurred the threat did not\\nalarm him he gave it hardly a second thought\\n\\nit was two years since he had seen stuart floyd since he arrested him\\nfor complicity in the looting of the imperial loan company by morris\\ngarland and moses hart its two treacherous managers the case involving\\nthe felonious pawning of lady waldmeres valuable jewels held by them\\nfor collateral\\n\\nthe prosecution however had not ended quite as nick had expected both\\ngarland and hart were convicted and sent to the states prison where\\nthey still were confined\\n\\nthe two women involved in the abduction of lady waldmere vera vantoon\\nand her sister leah were given a year for that part of the crime it\\ncould not be proved however that either was involved in the looting of\\nthe loan company they since had served their time and been liberated\\n\\nthough nick carter was convinced of his guilt moreover stuart floyd\\nhad with the help of an able criminal lawyer contrived to slip through\\nthe fingers of justice both garland and hart had sworn that floyd knew\\nnothing about the looting that he had acted only as their agent in the\\nhandling of the jewels and that he was entirely ignorant of the\\nabduction of lady waldmere\\n\\nnick felt morally sure however that stuart floyd was back of the whole\\nbusiness despite the fact that it could not be proved to the\\nsatisfaction of the jury that had acquitted him\\n\\nnick was not surprised at floyds subsequent disappearance for he had\\nposed as a person of character and a popular man about town the\\nsuspicion was one that would not down however and the stigma\\napparently had resulted in his disappearance though none could say\\nwhere he had gone it was with some surprise therefore that the\\ndetective encountered him that morning\\n\\nnick had not lost sight of lord waldmere and his wife in the meantime\\nand he was an occasional caller at the handsome residence bought in\\nriverside drive by the englishman who had been cast out and\\ndisinherited because of his marriage with mary royal at that time a\\nbeautiful american chorus girl\\n\\nlord waldmeres investments in colorado mines had proved very\\nprofitable however and he fast was becoming further estranged from his\\nnative land and more and more infatuated with american life and customs\\nin part due to the wishes of his charming wife he had dropped his\\nenglish title becoming simply mr archie waldmere though his prestige\\nhad won him a legion of friends and admission into the first circles of\\nsociety\\n\\nnick carter was informed on all of these points and of all of the\\nfriends of the waldmeres none was more friendly and gratefully regarded\\nthan the famous detective\\n\\nit was with some little surprise nevertheless three days following his\\nmeeting with stuart floyd that nick received an urgent telephone\\nsummons to the waldmere residence with his chief assistants chick\\ncarter and patsy garvan\\n\\nthe communication came from mr waldmere himself convincing nick that\\nsomething very serious had occurred without waiting to inquire into the\\ndetails however he at once complied in company with chick and patsy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe stolen plate\\n\\n\\nit was eleven oclock when nick carter arrived with chick and patsy at\\nthe waldmere residence that morning the butler admitted them while\\nlord waldmere and his wife came hurrying through the broad handsomely\\nfurnished hall to meet them\\n\\ncome into the library said lord waldmere after their greeting by\\njove im deucedly glad you could come so quickly im in a terrible\\nstate im the victim of a beastly job as you american detectives call\\nthem pon my word carter i dont know whether im afoot or horseback\\nim infernally upset dont you know\\n\\nwont it be well then waldmere to let your wife tell me what has\\noccurred nick suggested interrupting i infer that it is something\\nof a criminal nature or you would not require my services\\n\\nthat hits the bally nail on the nob groaned the englishman i have\\nbeen jolly well robbed mr carter jolly well robbed and\\n\\nsit down archie dear and let me state the case mrs waldmere\\ninterrupted after all had entered the finely furnished library i can\\ninform mr carter much more briefly than you and he evidently feels\\nthat time may be valuable\\n\\nlord waldmere always yielded to his wife at which none wondered for\\nher beauty and charm were quite irresistible\\n\\narchie has as you already know decided to remain permanently in\\namerica or at least until a reconciliation has been effected with his\\nfamily of which there appears to be no prospect as long as his father\\nthe earl of eggleston lives\\n\\nyes i know about that nick bowed\\n\\narchie not only has been successful in his mining ventures mrs\\nwaldmere continued but he also inherited from his mother who was the\\nearls second wife nearly all of her extensive estate\\n\\nit comprised the london residence of her father also the old manor\\nhouse and estate in dorsetshire with all that they contained this\\nincluded a fine library numerous costly paintings portraits and other\\nfurnishings and also a large quantity of valuable silver and gold\\nplate which has been a heritage of the waldmeres for two centuries it\\nis of the massive and beautifully engraved kind that we do not see in\\nthese days and it is valued at something like a hundred thousand\\ndollars\\n\\nthats the blooming truth mr carter nodded waldmere i would jolly\\nwell rather have given a leg old top than have lost it\\n\\nlost it echoed nick do you mean that you have been robbed of the\\nplate\\n\\nyes bah jove thats just what i mean the bally stuff you see\\nwas\\n\\none moment archie mrs waldmere interposed lets state the facts\\nbriefly\\n\\nyes do so put in nick attentively\\n\\nafter having bought this beautiful residence which still is only\\npartly furnished she continued archie decided to ship over here most\\nof his english furnishings including the library the paintings and\\nportraits a quantity of costly rugs tapestries and draperies and\\nalso all of the gold and silver plate\\n\\nah i see nick nodded the plate has been stolen during\\ntransportation\\n\\nexactly\\n\\ntell me what you know about it\\n\\nthat can be briefly told archie wrote to his london agent mr cherry\\na thoroughly reliable man giving him all of the necessary directions\\nmr cherry had the goods packed for shipment they filled twenty large\\ncases these were marked and numbered to correspond with an inventory\\nmailed to archie stating what each case contained\\n\\nthe inventory was duly received nick questioned\\n\\nyes it came nearly two weeks ago\\n\\ncontinue\\n\\nthe goods were shipped on the liner _flodora_ which should have\\narrived in new york five days ago as you may have read in the\\nnewspapers however she had a break in some part of her engine and was\\ncompelled to put into boston where her cargo was discharged and shipped\\nto new york by rail we were notified by new york agents on the day of\\nher arrival informing us how our shipment would be forwarded\\n\\ni follow you said nick\\n\\nto guard against any mishap mr carter we then sent our chauffeur to\\nboston to engage a special car for our goods and to see that all of the\\ntwenty cases were put into it\\n\\nwhat is his name\\n\\nfrank gilbert i have known him for years he is strictly honest and\\ncapable he remained in boston and saw the twenty cases put into the\\nfreight car he also saw that it was properly closed and sealed the car\\nwas sent on an hour later for the train was being made up at the time\\nand it arrived here and was sidetracked in the railway yard early this\\nmorning we were notified by telephone and told that we could take away\\nthe goods\\n\\nwhat more mrs waldmere nick inquired\\n\\nfollowing our instructions gilbert already had made arrangements with\\nmacklin  dale the express company to bring the cases to this house\\nshe continued we telephoned to them at once and were told that they\\nwould have a van at the car at ten oclock we sent gilbert there at\\nhalf past nine with the bill of lading which the freight agent requires\\nfrom strangers before he will deliver the goods gilbert arrived at the\\ncar at precisely ten oclock no dray was there\\n\\nthe truckman was late\\n\\nsomething more than that he was sent as agreed but was stopped on\\nhis way by a policeman who claimed to identify him as a crook wanted by\\nthe authorities and who detained him half an hour to question him\\n\\nhm i see nick nodded something more indeed mrs waldmere\\n\\nin the meantime mr carter another wagon bearing the firm name of\\nthe express company went to the railway yard two men were in charge of\\nit they presented a forged bill of lading stating that they had been\\nsent to take away three of the cases the numbers of which were\\nspecified as soon as possible one of the yard hands was sent to the\\ncar with them and the cases were delivered to them about twenty minutes\\nbefore gilbert arrived they were the three cases mr carter that\\ncontained the valuable waldmere plate\\n\\nyes by jove and the bally rascals got away with them cried\\nwaldmere in tones of bitter dismay ive been jolly well robbed mr\\ncarter jolly well robbed of\\n\\none moment waldmere said nick checking him with a gesture your\\nwife has made this crime perfectly clear to me just how it was\\naccomplished is not quite as plain we must look into it i infer mrs\\nwaldmere there is nothing more of importance that you can add\\n\\nno nothing mr carter she replied thats the whole story\\n\\nthat on the contrary is only the beginning of the story corrected\\nnick much must be done and with some risk i anticipate before the\\nwhole story is told what besides sending for me have you done about\\nthe robbery\\n\\nnothing said mrs waldmere gilbert informed us of it by telephone\\nwe directed him to have the car reclosed and locked pending an\\ninvestigation and i then advised archie to telephone to you and place\\nthe case in your hands he did so immediately\\n\\nnick looked at his watch it was nearly twelve oclock two hours had\\npassed since the crime was committed it was obvious to him of course\\nthat the crooks had made a big haul and got safely away with their\\nplunder\\n\\nnick glanced expressively at patsy garvan after a moment and the latter\\nrightly read the look in his chiefs eyes he arose almost immediately\\nand sauntered into the adjoining hall closing the library door when he\\npassed out of the room he knew that nick wanted to be sure that the\\nfollowing conversation was not heard by any of the servants\\n\\nbefore beginning an investigation mr waldmere i wish to caution you\\nand your wife to say nothing about any views i may express neither to\\nyour friends nor in the hearing of your servants said nick addressing\\nboth quite impressively though you did not observe i directed one of\\nmy assistants to close the door and wait for me in the hall that will\\ninsure us against an eavesdropper\\n\\nbut hang it my dear carter im deucedly well sure that all of my\\nservants are trustworthy waldmere quickly asserted pon my word\\nsir\\n\\nthe word of one of them or possibly more may not be near as good as\\nyou think nick interrupted permit me to be the judge please and do\\nwhat i have directed\\n\\ncertainly mr carter put in mrs waldmere you may depend upon it\\n\\nit must be obvious to you of course that this theft was very\\ncarefully planned and quickly committed with definite information of\\nyour designs and what was to be stolen otherwise it could not possibly\\nhave been accomplished in the way it was done\\n\\nsurely not nick chick nodded thats dead open and shut\\n\\nto whom have you confided your intentions waldmere outside of this\\nhouse nick inquired\\n\\nonly to my london agent and the expressman i employed but the latter\\ncannot have known what the three cases contained\\n\\nyou have confided in none of your friends or acquaintances\\n\\nno not one\\n\\nbut you have discussed the matter here at times with your wife\\n\\nyes certainly\\n\\nyour london agent is reliable you say\\n\\nabsolutely waldmere declared there is no question about it\\n\\nobviously then the information obtained by the crooks must have been\\nimparted by some one who overheard you discussing your designs and who\\nhas been constantly informed of your intentions and what was being done\\nnaturally of course suspicion points to one of your servants\\n\\nbut\\n\\ndont lets argue the point nick again interrupted let me have my\\nway waldmere that we may get after the crooks as quickly as possible\\n\\nvery well its up to you\\n\\nnow to proceed how many servants do you employ\\n\\nsix said mrs waldmere picard our french chef a woman in the\\nkitchen named maggie coyle\\n\\nyoung or well along in years\\n\\nabout fifty\\n\\nnot likely then to be in such a job said nick besides her\\nposition in the house as well as that of the chef would have made it\\ndifficult for them to have learned all of the necessary details they\\nare out of it\\n\\nwe employ a butler john patterson continued mrs waldmere also my\\nmaid della martin and a maid for general work named minerva grand\\nall came well recommended i have known our chauffeur frank gilbert\\nfor years as i have said\\n\\nthey comprise your list of servants\\n\\nyes\\n\\nhas gilbert returned from the railway yard\\n\\nhe has and is waiting in the basement he met the truckman sent by\\nmacklin  dale and we directed him to bring him here also thinking\\nyou might wish to question both\\n\\ni will do so said nick have the truckman sent up here i want both\\nof you to wait in another room while i am talking with him also with\\ngilbert whom i will send for a little later do not ask my reasons but\\nkindly comply\\n\\nwaldmere looked a bit surprised but he made no objection he arose at\\nonce and left the room with his wife\\n\\nwell what do you make of it chick inquired while they waited for\\nthe truckman it looks to me like a bit of remarkably clever work\\n\\nnick nodded and added\\n\\nwith inside help\\n\\nyou feel sure of that\\n\\nreasonably sure said nick the circumstances point to absolutely\\ndefinite information on the part of the crooks much more so than if\\nthere had been only three cases shipped and all three stolen\\n\\nthats true chick allowed\\n\\nthey must have known the numbers of the three cases containing the gold\\nplate they must have known that the location of those three particular\\ncases in the freight car was such that they could quickly remove them\\nor they could not have figured so fine as to time they got away with\\nthem mind you only twenty minutes before gilbert arrived in the yard\\n\\nthats right too by jove\\n\\nfurthermorebut here comes our man nick broke off abruptly we will\\nsize it up later\\n\\nthe truckman had entered while the detective was speaking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnick carters craft\\n\\n\\nnick carter needed only to glance at the face of the man who had entered\\nto feel assured of his honesty he was a rugged redcheeked scotchman\\nof nearly fifty years clad in a checked blouse and overalls and\\ncarrying in one of his begrimed and calloused hands a faded woolen cap\\n\\ncome nearer my man said nick pleasantly what is your name\\n\\ntom mclauren sir he replied complying\\n\\nhow long have you been in the employ of macklin  dale\\n\\nten years sir\\n\\ni have been told on what job you were sent out this morning also that\\nyou were detained by a policeman who\\n\\nthats wrong sir mclauren said quickly i may have said a\\npoliceman sir not thinking but he was a plainclothes man who stopped\\nme\\n\\none you knew by sight\\n\\nno sir but he showed me his detective badge and\\n\\ni understand nick interrupted where did he stop you\\n\\nin fortyeighth street sir when i was driving through from second\\navenue he held me up and made me pull off to one side of the street\\nand then he began to question me as much as saying that i was a crook\\nhe was looking for i tried to convince him he was wrong but the\\ninfernal bonehead wouldnt have it and he threatened to take me down to\\nheadquarters team and all unless i answered his questions he hung me\\nup there for near half an hour sir until i got hot around my collar\\nand told him hed better pull a gink who went by just then instead of\\nme\\n\\nsome one you knew questioned nick\\n\\ni know him by sight sir thats all\\n\\nwhy didnt you appeal to him then and have him vouch for you\\n\\nid have got fat sir doing that said mclauren with an expressive\\ngrin surest thing you know in that case the dick would have collared\\nme\\n\\nyou mean that the man who went by is a crook\\n\\ni reckon so though i couldnt swear to it said mclauren but hes a\\ngangman all right and ive heard hes a gunman as well i only know\\nhim by sight sir\\n\\ndo you know his name\\n\\ni do\\n\\nwhat is it\\n\\ntim bannon sir though hes better known as bug bannon being a small\\nbowlegged chap with a head like a bullet\\n\\nhumph grunted nick who knew all about the young gangster did he\\nsay anything or look at the man who had stopped you\\n\\nhe did not he was whistling and on the other side of the street\\n\\nhow much longer were you detained mclauren\\n\\nonly a couple of minutes sir the dick seemed to see he was in wrong\\nand he let me go\\n\\ndescribe him said nick\\n\\nhe looked all right sir as far as that goes said the truckman\\nhes a mediumbuilt man kind of pale but with dark hair and a beard\\nhe\\n\\nthats all mclauren nick interrupted send in frank gilbert when\\nyou go out wait until i have finished with him and i will give you\\nfurther instructions\\n\\ni hope you dont think sir that i\\n\\ni know that you had no hand in the robbery nick again cut in\\nanticipating what the other was about to say do what i have directed\\nand say nothing about my inquiries\\n\\ni will not sir mclauren assured him with a look of relief as he\\nturned and left the room\\n\\nby jove this looks as if chick began\\n\\nhe quickly checked himself however when the chauffeur who had been\\nwaiting in the hall entered and closed the door\\n\\nhe was a tall cleancut man in the twenties with a frank face and\\nclear blue eyes that met with convincing gaze the somewhat searching\\nscrutiny of the detective\\n\\ni wish to ask you only a few questions gilbert said nick much may\\ndepend upon the information i obtain from you however so be very\\ncareful when replying dont overlook any little incident that may have\\noccurred however trivial it may seem to you\\n\\ni understand you mr carter bowed the chauffeur taking the chair to\\nwhich the detective waved him i will overlook nothing sir\\n\\nto begin with then have you told any person about the intentions of\\nyour employer or why you were going to boston\\n\\nnot one word sir said gilbert i was for two years in the chorus\\nwith miss royal now lady waldmere and i have always felt a very\\nsincere regard for her i would cut out my tongue or lose a hand\\nrather than harm her in any way\\n\\ni believe you said nick tell me now just what you did after\\narriving in boston omit nothing of importance\\n\\ni was there only one day gilbert replied i first went to the\\ncustomhouse where i saw the collector and gave a voucher for what the\\nimported cases contain and i got permission to have them sent to new\\nyork without delay\\n\\nand then\\n\\ni then went to the pier where the _flodora_ was docked i was fortunate\\nin finding that all of the cases had been discharged from the liner and\\ni at once had them taken to the railway to be put into a special\\nfreight car a train was being made up when i arrived there and i\\narranged for the car with the yardmaster whom i found in his office in\\nthe freight house\\n\\ndid you see the twenty cases put into the car\\n\\ni did sir i also saw the car closed and locked\\n\\nwho handled the cases when transferred from the dray to the car\\n\\nthe truckman assisted by a train hand in the car\\n\\nwho else was present\\n\\nonly one other man sir who directed the loading of the car i\\nsupposed he was one of the yard hands employed for that kind of work he\\nappeared to have some authority\\n\\nhe appeared so to you\\n\\nyes certainly\\n\\nand to the train hand no doubt\\n\\nso far as i noticed the train hand did what he was told\\n\\nwhen and where did you first see this man\\n\\nhe came along just as we were beginning to load the car he at once\\nbegan to tell the train hand where to put the cases i supposed he\\nwanted the car loaded in a certain way\\n\\nthat was a natural supposition nick allowed smiling a bit oddly\\nthe train hand had much the same impression no doubt\\n\\nhe appeared to mr carter\\n\\nhe probably inferred that this officious individual had an interest in\\nthe cases and a right to say where they should be put said nick\\nnever mind about that however did you see the man after the car was\\nclosed and locked\\n\\nonly when we were leaving the yard\\n\\ndid he leave with you\\n\\nhe went as far as the freight house with me then he took the bill of\\nlading given me by the freight agent and told me to wait while he got a\\nduplicate of it for the waybill clerk i did so mr carter and he\\nreturned in about five minutes and gave me the bill of lading i\\nsupposed he was one of the yard officials and that was the last i saw\\nof him\\n\\nyou returned to new york that night\\n\\nyes sir\\n\\ndescribe the man mr gilbert said nick\\n\\nwhy sir he was a man of medium build and about forty years old he\\nwas quite dark but with a rather pallid skin and\\n\\nthat is sufficient nick interrupted tell mr waldmere that he may\\nsend you and mclauren after the seventeen cases remaining in the car i\\nwill look after gettingthe other three\\n\\ndo you mean mr carter that\\n\\nnever mind what i mean nick again cut in say nothing about the\\nquestions i have asked do only what i have directed\\n\\ni will sir\\n\\ngilbert bowed and withdrew he looked as if something unthought of\\nbefore had suddenly dawned upon him\\n\\nby jove we seem to be getting down to cases chick remarked when the\\nchauffeur had closed the door\\n\\nwe are nick tersely agreed\\n\\nyou think the man who showed up just in time to direct loading the\\nfreight car\\n\\nis the man we want or one of them put in nick there is no doubt of\\nthat he got by both gilbert and the train hand by assuming an air of\\nauthority that completely deceived both one supposed him a road\\nemployee the other the owner perhaps of the twenty cases\\n\\nmost likely\\n\\nbe that as it may he got the three cases containing the gold plate\\nplaced so near the car door that they could be quickly removed after\\narriving in new york he further fooled gilbert moreover into letting\\nhim forge a copy of the bill of lading probably on a blank already\\nobtained\\n\\nsure thing chick nodded thats as plain as twice two\\n\\nhe was on gilberts trail from the time he left new york\\n\\nif we could discover his identity\\n\\nleave that to me nick interrupted call in patsy also waldmere and\\nhis wife staywait one moment\\n\\nnick arose abruptly and approached a large rolltop desk near one of the\\nwalls the cover of it was raised taking a lens from his pocket nick\\nexamined the polished woodwork on all sides including the faces of\\nseveral small interior drawers surveying all of them at an angle that\\ncaught the light in a way that served his purpose\\n\\nnow chick im ready he remarked resuming his seat\\n\\npatsy garvan entered a few moments later followed immediately by\\nwaldmere and his wife both gazed inquiringly at the detective anxious\\nto know what he had learned but nick did not inform them instead\\naddressing waldmere he said with seeming indifference\\n\\ni will have finished in a short time i think you said waldmere that\\nthe inventory of the twenty cases which was mailed to you from london\\nwas received about two weeks ago\\n\\nyes just about that waldmere nodded\\n\\nwhere is it\\n\\nin my desk\\n\\nhas it been there most of the time\\n\\nyes it is in one of the small drawers\\n\\ni inferred so nick said a bit dryly may i see it\\n\\ncertainly\\n\\nbefore the englishman could open the small interior drawer toward which\\nhe reached however nick checked him by saying abruptly as if suddenly\\nhit with another idea\\n\\nstay i dont think i really care to see it instead waldmere i would\\nlike to question your butler and the two maids\\n\\nvery well\\n\\nwhich of them mrs waldmere has charge of this room nick added\\nturning to her i refer to the sweeping and dusting\\n\\nminerva grand she replied\\n\\nthe general housemaid\\n\\nyes she is a very sweet and dainty girl\\n\\ncall in both maids and the butler said nick turning to waldmere\\nagain i will question each of them do not interfere with me nor\\nvolunteer any suggestion if i give either of them an order\\n\\nwaldmere looked very much puzzled but he bowed without replying and\\nrang for the butler\\n\\npatterson came in with the two maids a little later he was stiff and\\nsedate the type of man who could not commit a crime if he tried he\\npresented a marked contrast to the two girls both of whom were pretty\\nand only just turned twenty\\n\\ndella martin the elder was a dark capablelooking girl who responded\\nwith manifest confidence to the detectives questions evincing no sign\\nof fear\\n\\nthe other minerva grand was the more attractive she was slender and\\ndainty with a face like that of a doll her complexion was a clear pink\\nand white her eyes wonderfully blue her mouth well formed and\\nsensitive an abundance of wavy yellow hair appeared like a halo over\\nher winsome countenance a more artless and innocentlooking girl could\\nnot be imagined and her deportment was in keeping with her looks\\n\\nnick carter questioned all three but his inquiries were really only a\\nblind to dispel misgivings on the part of either of them and neither\\nchick nor patsy could fathom at what he was driving\\n\\nafter several minutes however nick turned to minerva grand and said\\npleasantly\\n\\ni wish you would bring me a cup of hot water with a spoon in it have\\nit quite hot\\n\\nyes sir i will she replied bowing demurely\\n\\ni want to dissolve an alkali to make a chemical test\\n\\nyes sir please you said minerva hastening to obey\\n\\nyou may go patterson and you nick added addressing the others if\\nyou are wanted again i will ring\\n\\nboth withdrew and waldmere was about to ask a question he caught a\\nforbidding gleam in the detectives eyes however and he said nothing\\n\\nnick fished out part of a lozenge from his pocket a bit of\\nconfectionery that he happened to have he held it in the palm of his\\nhand when minerva returned with a cup of steaming water containing a\\nsilver spoon\\n\\nhold the spoon a moment my girl said nick taking the cup from her\\n\\nminerva removed it without speaking\\n\\nnick dropped the piece of lozenge into the water then glanced up at her\\npretty face\\n\\nnow the spoon if you please said he taking it from her that is\\nall thank you you may go\\n\\nminerva bowed blushing and left the room\\n\\nchick patsy and the waldmeres were still more puzzled\\n\\nnick arose and walked to the window unobserved by the others he took\\nhis lens from his pocket and briefly studiedthe finger print left by\\nthe girl on the steamdampened handle of the silver spoon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhat nick had learned\\n\\n\\nit was after one oclock when nick carter left the waldmere residence\\nafter having given such further instructions as the circumstances seemed\\nto require\\n\\ntwenty minutes later found him seated in his business office with chick\\nand patsy when he at once began to tell them what he thought of the\\ncase\\n\\nthere is little to it and also much to it said he enigmatically we\\nmust do some quick work mighty quick work or farewell to the waldmere\\nplate\\n\\nhow do you size it up chief questioned patsy who saw that nick was\\nsomewhat anxious over the outcome of the case\\n\\nthat may be told in a nutshell nick replied waldmeres designs were\\nknown by his servants one of them put a gang of crooks wise to the\\npossibility of this robbery and what could be derived from it\\n\\nsurely put in chick thats as plain as twice two though waldmere\\ndoes not think so\\n\\nthe information was stealthily learned from the inventory received two\\nweeks ago nick continued a copy of it was secretly made no doubt\\nand given to one of the crooks\\n\\nten to one chick nodded\\n\\nthat gave them the numbers of the three cases containing the gold\\nplate and they afterward were kept constantly informed as to the time\\nof their arrival and of what waldmeres intentions consisted\\n\\nthats obvious also\\n\\njust how she was led into this crime however and with whom she has\\nbeen communicating and handing out this information remain to be\\ndiscovered it must be discovered too without delay\\n\\nshe exclaimed patsy gazing do you suspect one of the maids\\nchief\\n\\nmore than suspect patsy nick replied i am sure of her\\n\\nwhich one chief\\n\\nminerva grand\\n\\ngee whiz that dollfaced girl she dont look capable of stealing a\\nfeather from a peacocks tail\\n\\nthats too true for a joke patsy said chick a bit dryly are you\\nreally sure of it nick\\n\\ndead sure chick and then some\\n\\nby jove it seems almost incredible\\n\\nlet me explain said nick i found on the highly polished face of one\\nof the small interior drawers in waldmeres desk numerous dainty finger\\nprints\\n\\nhm is that so\\n\\ni might not have been so quick to suspect however if i had found the\\nsame on the adjoining small drawers also but they were only on one it\\nwas the one to which waldmere reached when i asked him to let me see the\\ninventory i already felt sure it was in that drawer\\n\\nah that explains it said chick smiling i wondered at what you\\nwere driving\\n\\ngee i was in on that all right put in patsy i couldnt fathom\\nit\\n\\ni suspected that they were the finger prints of the girl who sweeps and\\ndusts the room nick continued that would have given her an\\nopportunity or many of them in fact to stealthily examine the\\ninventory and even make a copy of it\\n\\nsurely chick nodded\\n\\ni decided however that i had better clinch my suspicion i found the\\nsame dainty finger print on the damp silver spoon which i had her bring\\nand hold for a moment\\n\\ngosh that did settle it said patsy clever work chief all right\\n\\ni am convinced of the guilt of this girl and the part she has played in\\nthe robbery\\n\\nwhy didnt you arrest her then and force a confession from her\\nchick inquired\\n\\nthat last might not be easily done nick replied furthermore the\\ngirl may not know the crooks\\n\\nnot know them how can that be providing your suspicions are correct\\n\\nshe may have been lured into this by a supposed friend one who is in\\nleague with the crooks and who is acting as a sort of gobetween\\n\\ni see the point bowed chick minerva grand might not be able to put\\nus on the track of the gang itself\\n\\nthats the point precisely said nick i would not take the chance of\\narresting her therefore or even of letting her know that i suspect\\nher that is why i did not make a special mark of her in my inquiries\\nalso why i have kept all this from the waldmeres and left them entirely\\nin the dark i feared they might betray me to the girl by some word or\\nlook\\n\\ni see\\n\\nnow to go a step further the man who held up mclauren was one of the\\ngang nick continued he was in reality the chief of the gang he is\\nthe same man who followed frank gilbert to boston and who so artfully\\nhad the three cases put near the door of the freight car and afterward\\nsucceeded in getting a forged copy of the bill of lading he is a keen\\nand clever rascal he is all the mustard in the pot that fellow\\n\\nyou speak as if you already know him said chick gazing\\n\\ni do know him chick\\n\\nthe dickens whom do you suspect\\n\\na man who stopped me in madison avenue a few days ago nick declared\\nwith more feeling it was the first time i have seen him for a couple\\nof years he cursed me for having put him to the bad and he threatened\\nme with something no less strange thanthe melting pot\\n\\nthe melting pot chick echoed perplexedly what did he mean\\n\\nthats right too what questioned patsy\\n\\nnick carter laughed a bit grimly\\n\\ni did not know what he meant at the time nor seriously care he\\nreplied after a moment i now know however what he meant by the\\nmelting pot he threatened to put something over on me and send me all\\nto the bad it now is plain enough to me that he had this robbery in\\nmind and the job well in hand\\n\\nyou mean\\n\\nits the melting pot not for me chick in reality but for this\\npriceless waldmere plateunless we can move quickly enough to prevent\\nit\\n\\nby gracious chief that must be what he meant cried patsy with\\ncountenance lighting\\n\\nbut who is the man nick chick demanded you have said nothing to me\\nabout meeting him\\n\\ni thought it hardly worth while nick replied the threats of such\\nrascals have no weight with me the man was stuart floyd\\n\\ngreat guns said chick is he in new york again\\n\\nvery much here\\n\\nwere you aware of it before\\n\\nno\\n\\nhe must have been lying mighty low i have not heard so much as a hint\\nat it\\n\\nall the same chick he is the man behind the gun in this job nick\\nsaid confidently he has got back at waldmere for that other affair in\\nwhich he was put on the rocks\\n\\nby jove the case seems to be shaping up\\n\\nit is shaping up to that extent nick went on but floyd is much too\\nkeen and cautious to have figured openly in this robbery with such a\\ngirl as minerva grand there is a gobetween either a girl friend or a\\nlover thats who we must find and get after\\n\\nby jove i guess you are right chick said more gravely\\n\\nsure thing put in patsy\\n\\nwe will take that chance nick replied it is nearly a safe gamble\\ntoo that floyd after holding up mclauren as a pretended detective\\nwaited only for bug bannon to show up before he would release the\\ntruckman\\n\\nthats how i sized it up chick agreed\\n\\nyou think bannon is in the job chief questioned patsy who had lost\\npart of what had been said in waldmeres library\\n\\ni do patsy\\n\\nin what way\\n\\nhe probably was watching in the railway yard when the three cases were\\ntaken away by others of the gang nick explained bannon then flew up\\nto fortyeighth street to covertly notify floyd that the two men had got\\nsafely away with their plunder\\n\\ngee that seems reasonable\\n\\nfloyd then released mclauren added the detective i suspected all\\nthis when mclauren was telling his story\\n\\nwed better get after bannon then chick suggested\\n\\nboth bannon and minerva grand said nick both must be shadowed\\n\\nthats the stuff chief\\n\\nthis is the girls afternoon and evening out and she may have an\\nappointment with the suspected gobetween the gang will have learned\\nthat we are on the case of course and may look to minerva grand to\\nfind out what we make of it\\n\\ntheyll get fat chief on what she can tell them laughed patsy\\n\\nyou had better follow up the girl chick and be governed by\\ncircumstances\\n\\nthat will suit me nick all right chick said agreeably\\n\\nnot having communicated openly with floyd and i having said nothing\\nabout this at the waldmere residence bannon naturally will not fear\\nthat he is suspected nick added do you know him by sight patsy\\n\\nwell rather patsy exclaimed expressively i know the face of every\\nrat of his kind from harlem to the battery\\n\\nget out in disguise then and see what you can accomplish nick\\nabruptly directed i will begin a stillhunt for floyd himself in the\\nmeantime also for the two men who got away with the cases this work\\nmust be done in record time mind you or it will be all off with the\\nwaldmere plate\\n\\nrecord time goes cried patsy hastening to make ready\\n\\nby this time tomorrow perhaps unless we can prevent it the melting\\npot will have turned the priceless plate into ingots precluding\\nidentification and which could be sold for good hard cash nick\\ndeclared rising its up to us to head off that deviltry and round up\\nthese crooks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nangel face\\n\\n\\nchick carter was the first of the three detectives to leave home on the\\nwork assigned him carefully disguised chick boarded a subway train and\\narrived shortly before three oclock in the neighborhood of the waldmere\\nresidence\\n\\nnick had made it a point to learn before leaving that morning that none\\nof the servants were in the habit of going out before three on the\\nafternoon and evening allowed them\\n\\nchick easily found a concealment from which he could watch both the side\\nand rear door of the house from one of which he knew that minerva grand\\nwould depart if she availed herself of the privilege afforded though\\ninclined to agree with nick in that the latters suspicions were\\ncorrect it seemed almost incredible to chick that a girl of minervas\\nappearance and bearing could willingly have a hand in any kind of crime\\n\\nshes the most innocentlooking wisp of a girl i ever did see he said\\nto himself while surveying the doors and windows of the stately\\nresidence she may have been lured into the job or forced into it by\\nsome means it would be very like stuart floyd to take advantage of her\\nartlessness knowing that she would be about the last to invite\\nsuspicion this afternoon and evening ought to settle it at all\\nevents\\n\\nthere was no sign of minerva grand however at any of the windows the\\nhouse appeared to have relapsed into its customary state of dignity and\\nrepose nor in any direction moreover could chick discover any other\\nperson watching it and he rightly inferred that the crooks felt\\ntolerably sure that the truth was not even suspected\\n\\nhis vigil proved to be longer than he anticipated the minutes\\nlengthened into hours six oclock came but no sign of the suspected\\ngirl though mrs waldmeres maid had left the house soon after four\\n\\nit may be by jove that she left before i arrived here thought\\nchick a bit impatient id better find out positively i might\\ntelephone to mrs waldmere from the next house orah there comes a\\nlight on the top floor it may be in the girls room\\n\\nthe sun had set and dusk was deepening to darkness the light that had\\ncaught chicks eye caused him to linger and watch a moment later he saw\\nminerva draw down the curtain and he knew he had not waited vainly\\n\\nshe may have been waiting for evening he said to himself she would\\nknow at least that there is less risk than in daylight or she may\\nhave an appointment for the evening as nick suspects\\n\\nchick then had not long to wait\\n\\nthe light in the upper room suddenly vanished presently the side door\\nof the house was opened and in the stream of light from the hall the\\ndainty figure of the girl appeared for a moment only to be lost briefly\\nin the gloom of the vestibule after she closed the door\\n\\nchick then saw her trip lightly down the steps and out to the street\\nclad in a trim jacket and a hat that only partly hid her abundance of\\nyellow hair\\n\\nafter turning the first corner however stealthily followed by the\\ndetective minerva stopped short and took a voluminous veil from her\\npocket which she carefully tied over her hat and hair then drew it\\ndown until it completely hid her girlish face\\n\\nthat does settle it thought chick constantly watching her shes\\noff on some evil mission nick sized her up correctly all right she\\nevidently has no fear of being followed which will make it all the\\neasier for me by jove this seems like chasing a fairy she cant weigh\\nmore than ninety pounds\\n\\nminerva had started off again with the detective after her\\n\\nten minutes brought her to a subway station where she took a downtown\\ntrain\\n\\nalighting at fortysecond street she walked briskly away and soon\\nbrought up opposite a restaurant and concert hall having a somewhat\\nunenviable reputation there she paused in a doorway to gaze over at the\\nlighted windows\\n\\nshes looking for some one or waiting for some one to show up\\nthought chick after briefly watching her i may get a line on the\\nparty before her by jove in case he already has arrived she cannot\\nsee from over there\\n\\nminerva still was lingering in the doorway\\n\\nleaving the corner on which he had paused to watch her chick sauntered\\ninto the place and bought a drink at the bar\\n\\nbeyond the barroom through a broad entrance adorned with potted palms\\nwas a large concert hall filled with numerous tables and with curtained\\nbooths flanking the side walls\\n\\npatrons of the place were seated at many of the tables eating\\ndrinking and smoking a score of waiters were hurrying to and fro in\\nthe rear of the hall an orchestra was playing popular airs the noise\\nand stir were incessant\\n\\ngazing into the broad mirror back of the bar chick suddenly made a\\ndiscoverya woman seated alone in one of the nearest booths\\n\\nthe curtains were partly drawn and chick would not have discovered her\\nsave for the angle afforded by the mirror\\n\\nby gracious theres the connecting link he said to himself this\\ndoes settle it vera vantoon eh that jade who figured with stuart\\nfloyd in the looting of the loan company she was hand and glove with\\nfloyd at that time and its long odds that their intimacy has not\\nended this is the person for whom minerva grand is looking shes the\\nconnecting link all right by jove i must contrive to overhear what\\npasses between them\\n\\nchick was quick to take advantage of the girls delay in entering the\\nplace which he rightly inferred was due to diffidence and inexperience\\n\\nstepping back of the palms near the entrance to the concert hall chick\\nbeckoned to one of the waiters then at the bar he was a slender chap in\\na starched cap and a long white apron who appeared bright enough to\\ngrasp a situation without having it hammered into him\\n\\ni am a detective one of nick carters staff chick quietly informed\\nhim there is a woman in the third booth on this side of the hall have\\nyou noticed her\\n\\nyes sir nodded the waiter i serve at the tables nearest that\\nbooth\\n\\ndo you know her\\n\\nonly by sight she comes in here quite often\\n\\ncan you get me a cap and apron like yours\\n\\nyes by asking the manager\\n\\nwhere is he\\n\\nthe tall man near the end of the bar\\n\\nwhat is his name\\n\\nscoville\\n\\ncall him over here\\n\\nthe waiter obeyed returning with the manager to whom chick quickly\\nexplained the situation and stated what he wanted the mere mention of\\nnick carters name was sufficient to insure scovilles coöperation\\n\\nwhy sure thing he said after listening i would only bite off my\\nown nose by refusing slip around the end of the bar mr carter and\\ninto my private room ill fit you out in half a minute and be glad to\\naccommodate you in this matter\\n\\nchick did as directed gliding around into the managers office unseen\\nby any in the concert hall\\n\\nhalf a minute later wearing a cap and apron he emerged and mingled\\nwith the waiters selecting that side of the room on which was the booth\\nin which vera vantoon was seated\\n\\nthe entire episode had transpired in less than five minutes yet chick\\nhad hardly arrived near the booth mentioned when he saw minerva grand\\nentering the concert hall with her veil partly raised\\n\\nat he same moment too he saw vera vantoon thrust her hand between the\\ncurtains of the booth and beckon to the approaching girl\\n\\nminerva passed him without so much as a glance and hurriedly entered the\\nbooth\\n\\nchick edged nearer to it remaining as stiff and staid as a wooden\\nindian within three feet of the drawn curtains there then being no\\npersons at the near tables for him to serve\\n\\nchick was near enough to hear the first words that came through the\\ncurtains of the booth and most of what followed when the voices of the\\ntwo women were lowered\\n\\nhello angel face vera vantoon exclaimed clasping both hands of the\\ngirl heavens but you were a long time getting here\\n\\ngetting here echoed minerva evidently in nervous excitement the\\ngetting here cuts no ice i could have got here long ago its where im\\nlikely to get after leaving here thats what troubles me i didnt\\nthink you would serve me such a trick vera on my word i didnt\\n\\nvera vantoon laughed a bit coarsely in cold and mirthless fashion\\n\\nso you are wise to it now are you she replied\\n\\nhow can i help being wise to it ill never forgive you vera never\\n\\ndont be foolish angel face returned the woman still clasping the\\ngirls hands ive done you the favor of your life think what youre\\nto gain\\n\\na prison cell mebbe\\n\\nrats nothing of that kind angel face take my word for it\\n\\nyour word aint much good you didnt tell me the truth\\n\\nabout what\\n\\nwhy you wanted that list of boxes and why i was to keep you posted as\\nto what the master and mistress were doing i know all about it now you\\nwere planning to rob them\\n\\nhm just so thought chick listening intently its as nick\\nsuspected this simpleton has been lured blindly into the crime by a\\ndesigning woman it was childs play for vera vantoon\\n\\nthe woman laughed again and slipped her arm around the girls waist\\n\\nwhat of it she replied with voice lowered dont be frightened at\\nthat think what youre to gain by it do you want to be a servant and\\nslave the whole of your life this little job will put you in right as\\nlong as you live\\n\\nbut im scared out of my wits vera\\n\\nnonsense\\n\\nim afraid well be caught\\n\\nrats how are you to be caught who would suspect you angel face only\\na clairvoyant would ever guess that you had a hand in it\\n\\nim not so sure\\n\\ntell me all about it said vera who evidently had a powerful\\ninfluence over the girl thats why i wanted you to meet me here\\ntonight tell me the whole business all that took place today in the\\nhouse ill see that nothing happens to you angel face\\n\\nyoull have all you can do you jade to look out for yourself\\nthought chick a bit grimly\\n\\nyielding to the womans persuasive tongue minerva then proceeded to\\nstate all that had transpired that morning in the waldmere residence in\\nso far as she knew and had been able to determine what it signified\\n\\nvera vantoon listened with knit brows and drawn lips slipping in a\\nquestion now and then but for most part quietly absorbing all that the\\nmisguided girl imparted\\n\\nhumph she grunted contemptuously after the girl had finished so\\nnick carter is on the case is he\\n\\nthat is the name of the man who questioned me nodded minerva\\n\\nwell we expected it sneered vera hell get fat on this case\\n\\nim afraid of him vera\\n\\nyou neednt be said the woman hell never question you again well\\nlook out for that youll never see him again angel face take my word\\nfor it\\n\\nthat sounds as if a job had been put up on nick chick said to\\nhimself if they get by with it now that ive got this shedevil under\\nmy eyes they will go some all right\\n\\nit had become obvious to chick that the girl had been a tool in the\\nhands of this woman and that he would learn nothing more by playing the\\neavesdropper then and there vera vantoon confiding nothing to her\\ncompanion who evidently was entirely ignorant of the identity of the\\nlatters confederates\\n\\nthey will separate after leaving here he said to himself the girl\\nwill probably go straight home there would be nothing for me in\\nremaining on her track ill drop her and get after the woman\\n\\ngliding noiselessly away from the position he had occupied chick\\nreturned to the managers office and resumed his discarded garments\\n\\nhe then sauntered out to the bar again from which he continued to watch\\nthe booth lest his own doings might have been observed by some spy in\\nleague with the woman who then would be warned of her danger\\n\\na furtive scrutiny for a few minutes convinced chick however that vera\\nvantoon had come alone to keep the appointment and he then returned to\\nthe street to await her departure\\n\\nfive minutes later both women came out and proceeded together as far as\\nthe nearest corner where they conversed briefly before separating\\n\\nminerva grand drew down her veil and hurried away in the direction of a\\nsubway station\\n\\nbound home thought chick now for the woman\\n\\nvera vantoon did not take a conveyance\\n\\nglancing sharply around she drew her cloak about her and walked rapidly\\naway heading for second avenue and then toward one of the lowest\\nsections of the east side\\n\\nten minutes brought her into a narrow street in one of the worst and\\nmost congested precincts of the city in so far as the buildings were\\nconcerned\\n\\nthey were old and of the lowest type crowded in nondescript fashion\\ninto the foul territory they occupied with a labyrinth of black alleys\\nrunning hither and thither among them and forming a maze through which\\ncrooks familiar with the surroundings could easily elude a pursuer even\\nthough nearly as well acquainted with the miserable quarters\\n\\nby jove shes heading for the lair of her confederates thought\\nchick after stealthily following her into the narrow street it may\\nnot be dead easy to trail her\\n\\nthis became doubly apparent in a very few moments there were but few\\npersons in the dismal street which made it more difficult for chick to\\nclosely follow her\\n\\nher dark figure too could be seen only at intervals when she passed\\none of the blurs of light that relieved only feebly the prevailing\\ngloom\\n\\nsuddenly nevertheless chick saw her turn asideand then he lost sight\\nof her\\n\\nhe waited with strained eyes for half a minute but could not discover\\nher\\n\\nby jove i mustnt let her give me the slip he muttered better\\narrest her than stand for that\\n\\nhe darted on with the last quickly reaching the spot where he last had\\nseen her\\n\\nthe woman had vanished as if the earth had swallowed her\\n\\nchick gazed sharply around and discovered the black entrance of an alley\\nbetween two gloomy buildings\\n\\nhang it she could not have gone in there he said to himself\\nirritated by the threatening mishap she did not go as far as that as\\nwell as i could tell it may be all off by thunder unless i can trace\\nher i wish now that i had arrested both her and that yellowhaired\\ngirl it now looks bad for fair\\n\\nchick was looking in vain all the while for the vanished woman\\n\\nit did not appear that she could have entered either of the buildings\\nnear which he last had seen her both were shrouded in darkness\\n\\nthe only refuge to which she could have resorted appeared to be the\\nalley mentioned and chick felt reasonably sure that she had not gone as\\nfar as that\\n\\nhe now turned in that direction nevertheless and crept into the gloomy\\nhole it was so dark he scarce could see his hand before his face he\\nreached into his pocket to get his searchlight\\n\\nas he did so he stumbled against something lying on the ground\\n\\nhe stooped and felt of it with his hand suppressing a cry of surprise\\n\\nhe had stumbled againstthe body of a man\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndown and out\\n\\n\\npatsy garvan while chick was engaged as described was working out\\nanother string of the bow by which nick carter was hoping not only to\\nsave the waldmere plate from the melting pot but also to round up the\\ncrooks who had stolen it\\n\\npatsys first move was to perfect a disguise that would have caused his\\nown wife not only to turn him down but even to have fired him out of\\nthe house if he had dared venture into it\\n\\nno more tough and sinisterlooking a chap ever stood in leather than\\nwas patsy garvan when he appeared in a lower section of the bowery about\\nfour oclock that afternoon\\n\\npatsy was not looking for bug bannon at that time though he knew the\\nnotorious young gangster by sight and many of the haunts in which he\\nmight possibly be found patsy was bent upon working out a scheme of his\\nown by which to accomplish his chiefs object\\n\\nthe nature of it appeared soon after he entered an inferior saloon in\\none of the side streets a haunt of the disreputable and where he\\nfinally found the person he had been seeking\\n\\nthis was an infamous character by the name of john flynn though he was\\nmuch better known to his select circle of friends and to the police as\\npilot flynn he had obtained this sobriquet from the fact that his chief\\nvocation if not his only one was that of a steerer for stuss games and\\nother gambling joints or in other words a pilot for such strangers as\\ncould be artfully lured to their own undoing\\n\\npatsy had had a case against this fellow a month before one that would\\nhave sent him to sing sing he had not pressed it nor even arrested\\nhim however because of the fact that flynn associated at times with\\ntwo other crooks much wanted by patsy and the police and through whom\\nhe hoped to discover them\\n\\nit was about half past four when patsy entered the saloon mentioned and\\nhe discovered flynn eating free lunch from a table in the rear of the\\nlong room there were many others in the dive and the entrance of patsy\\nwas hardly noticed he threaded his way through the smokefilled place\\nand brought up at flynns elbow\\n\\nhow are you pilot he said quietly\\n\\nflynn swung round and viewed him sharply through a pair of sinister\\nbeady black eyes\\n\\nwhats eating you he snarled under his breath suspiciously\\n\\ndont know me eh queried patsy\\n\\nnot so youd notice it\\n\\nwell dont show any surprise when i tell you cautioned patsy ive\\nbeen looking for you imwhisper patsy garvan\\n\\nflynns hangdog face lost some of its color he drew back muttering an\\noath then quickly added\\n\\nlooking for me youre not\\n\\nno im not going to take you in put in patsy nothing of that\\nkind\\n\\nwhat dye want then flynn asked with a look of relief\\n\\ni want you to do something for me\\n\\nwhats that\\n\\ncome into the back room and ill order some booze said patsy\\ntheres no one in there ill tell you while we fire a ball or two\\n\\nthis proposition suited flynn to the letter particularly since learning\\nthat he was not to be arrested but rather was in a fair way to acquire\\nfurther consideration on the part of the detective\\n\\nim with you he nodded thats good enough for me\\n\\npatsy led the way into a dingy rear room and rang for one of the\\nbartenders he appeared in a moment and took the order presently\\nreturning with the drinks patsy paid him and then closed the door\\ndrawing a chair to the bare table at which flynn had seated himself\\n\\nnow pilot well get down to business he said quietly with an\\nassurance the other did not quite fancy when did you last see bug\\nbannon\\n\\ni dunno said flynn craftyeyed it must be a week sure since i\\nhad me lamps on him\\n\\nyoure pretty good friends arent you\\n\\nfor all i know\\n\\nyou know you are said patsy a bit sharply come across with\\nstraight goods now or youll get all thats coming to you are you\\non\\n\\nsure\\n\\none word from me will send you up the river\\n\\ni know that garvan flynn grimly admitted what is it you want\\n\\ni want to find bug bannon between now and dark do you know where to\\nlook for him\\n\\ni might find him for you whats up\\n\\nim after a bunch that pulled off a robbery this morning\\n\\nhow does bannon fit in\\n\\nhes in touch with them and i want to nail them through him\\n\\nrats he wouldnt tell you said flynn hes no snitch he wouldnt\\nsqueal if he was in the chair\\n\\nthat may be true perhaps but with your help i can get the information\\ni want and very probably the crooks i am after said patsy in other\\nwords pilot i want you to put me in right with bannon\\n\\nwhats that inright gag questioned flynn distrustfully what dye\\nmean by that\\n\\npatsy made no bones over explaining\\n\\ni want you to go with me and find bannon he said curtly when we\\nhave found him you must introduce me to him as a particular pal of\\nyours sandy glynn by name and tell him that you knew me in chicago\\ntell him that you owe me a special service in return for something done\\nfor you and\\n\\nsay dye think i\\n\\nnever mind what i think pilot patsy interrupted youre going to\\ndo what i direct and do it right up to snuff or its you for the stone\\nhouse with the barred windows do you get me\\n\\nsure i get you growled flynn scowling darkly what more dye want\\n\\nyou must tell bannon that i am wanted by the chicago police that\\ndetectives are here after me for a burglary and that you want him to\\nfind a safe concealment for me where i can lie low till the dicks have\\ngone you must ask it as a special favor making it plain that he is the\\nonly one to whom you can turn to help you out hand it to him good and\\nstrong pilot for your liberty depends upon your making good thats\\nwhat i want of youand all i want ill do the rest\\n\\nflynns face wore a look as black as midnight he sat silent for a\\nmoment scowling daggers at the detective and then he snarled bitterly\\nbetween his teeth\\n\\nsay ill not do this\\n\\noh yes you will patsy quietly insisted\\n\\nyoure making a snitch of me a dirty cur a traitor to\\n\\nenough of that pilot patsy interrupted youre going to do it and\\ndo it up rightor youre going with me you know what that means\\n\\nbut bug bannon will knife me for it\\n\\nno he wont when i get through with him hell be where he cannot do\\nany knifing\\n\\nbut\\n\\nbesides patsy again cut in he need never know but what you thought\\nyou were acting on the level\\n\\nhow can that be\\n\\nyou can claim that you did know a crook named sandy glynn and with\\nwhom you were friendly in chicago you can insist that i was made up as\\na marker for him and that you did not dream that i was a detective you\\ncan get by all right with that story even if you and bannon do come\\ntogether again he would swallow it hands down coming from you\\n\\nthats the worst of it blast you flynn snarled fiercely thats why\\ni cant do it\\n\\nyouve got to do it pilot youll do it or do time\\n\\nthat goes does it questioned flynn hesitating\\n\\nyou bet it goes\\n\\nsuppose i make good all right will you promise never to give me\\naway\\n\\ncertainly\\n\\non the dead\\n\\nyou know me said patsy my word is as good as a government bond\\n\\nmebbe tis but i wish you were at the bottom of the east river flynn\\ngrowled harshly but ill do it hang you ill do it to save my own\\nskin\\n\\nwith no monkey business mind you cautioned patsy that will be all\\nyour life is worth\\n\\nill hand it to him right\\n\\ndo you know where to find him\\n\\ni can round him up between now and dark thats what you said\\n\\ncome on then said patsy rising lets lose no time about it\\n\\ndespite flynns assurance however nearly three hours were spent in a\\nvain search before he finally found the gangster\\n\\neight oclock that evening saw all three seated around a small table in\\na saloon in second avenue on which several rounds of drinks already had\\nbeen served\\n\\nflynn had told his story and had put it fully as strong as patsy garvan\\nhad directed\\n\\nit appeared to have made a favorable impression upon bannon as also had\\nthe disguised detective who had played his part to the letter\\n\\ni know a place all right and a gang youd fit in well with bannon\\nfinally said in response to a suggestion from patsy that he ought to\\nget under cover without delay theres a guy among em youd like to\\nmeet hes the big finger of the bunch\\n\\npatsy felt sure that he referred to stuart floyd\\n\\nthat will suit me bug and then some he assured the grinning rascal\\nyou will always find me ready to hold my end up\\n\\nthat sounds good to me glynn and the pilots not likely to put me in\\nwrong in any way\\n\\nill be off then if you two ginks are going said flynn when bannon\\nappeared willing to depart and take patsy along with him ill see you\\nagain tomorrow\\n\\nout the front way pilot bannon replied glancing toward the swinging\\ndoors its the back way and the alley for us\\n\\nso long then\\n\\nflynn arose with the last and hurried out of the place he was glad to\\nget away though himself a crook and a steerer the despicable part that\\nhe had played was far from his liking\\n\\nwell be off too sandy if youre ready bannon then said quietly\\n\\nthe sooner the better patsy nodded\\n\\nhalf a minute while i make sure the coast is clear\\n\\npatsy waited well pleased with the result of his subterfuge and the\\noutlook that now appeared to insure his complete success he was not\\ndeterred for a moment by the thought that he was carrying his life in\\nhis hand\\n\\nbannon sauntered into a back room evidently being perfectly familiar\\nwith the place and its surroundings he returned to the door a moment\\nlater and beckoned patsy to follow him\\n\\nive got him down pat all right flashed through patsys mind while\\nhe complied he dont so much as even scent a rat in the meal if i can\\nonly get next to floyd and the rest of the gangwell i can see their\\nfinish\\n\\nbannon conducted him out of a back door and around two old buildings in\\nthe rear which brought them into one of the crosstown streets he then\\nheaded for another section of the east sidethat to which chick carter\\nshadowed vera vantoon only a short time later\\n\\nall the while patsy kept up a quiet stream of talk describing the\\nsupposed burglary for which he was wanted and in a way to further\\nimpress bannon but never an inquisitive word to awaken a feeling of\\ndistrust\\n\\nnevertheless the unexpected happened in so far as patsy was concerned\\n\\nten minutes brought them to the street in which chick lost sight of his\\nquarry\\n\\nkeep your trap closed now cautioned bannon as they were nearing the\\nalley previously mentioned ive got to give a signal in half a\\nminute\\n\\nim dumb nodded patsy detecting no sign of treachery in the others\\neyes\\n\\nbannon halted upon arriving at the entrance to the alley he glanced up\\nand down the street noting that it was deserted and then he said\\nsoftly\\n\\nwait here and watch out in that direction well sneak through the\\nalley in half a minute and\\n\\npatsy heard no more\\n\\ninvoluntarily as it were he had turned his head to look in the\\ndirection indicated by his companion\\n\\nbannons hand then leaped from his side pocket it was gripping the\\nbarrel of a revolver it rose and fell like a flash the butt of the\\nweapon landing with a sickening thud squarely on patsys head\\n\\nhe went down and out and into dreamland as quickly and completely as if\\nfelled with an ax\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninto a trap\\n\\n\\nto one not versed in the detectives art the announcement of nick\\ncarter that he was going on a stillhunt after stuart floyd would have\\nsounded like a vain and vaunting assertion\\n\\nto hunt up one man among the million in new york a man presumably aware\\nof the fact that he was wanted by the police and therefore having a\\npotent incentive to keeping out of sightto attempt to hunt up such a\\nman would seem to a novice a vain and hopeless undertaking\\n\\nnone knew better than nick carter however the underworld and the ways\\nof its crooks\\n\\nnick did not seek floyd in any of the haunts to which such criminals\\nsometimes resort he knew there would be nothing in that\\n\\nhe reasoned however that floyd would leave no stone unturned to find\\nout what investigations were being made and what was known and suspected\\nabout the robbery and nick was much too keen to overlook the\\nprobability that the desired information might be covertly sought in the\\nrailway yard when frank gilbert and mclauren returned to the freight\\ncar to remove the remaining cases\\n\\nthis required two trips by the couple it being impossible to take them\\naway in a single load and it was during their second visit to the car\\nthat nick put in an appearanceor rather did not put in an\\nappearance\\n\\nfor without displaying any interest in the labors of the two men or in\\nthe contents of the car nick picked his way between several trains that\\nwere sidetracked in that part of the yard apparently seeking some other\\ncar in which he had an interest he was carefully disguised and felt\\nsure that he was safe from ordinary recognition\\n\\nnick had not long been thus engaged before he made a convincing\\ndiscovery peering under the long rows of freight cars he saw beyond\\nthat in which gilbert and mclauren were workingthe legs of a man\\n\\none fact alone convinced nick that his immediate suspicions were\\ncorrect the legs were motionless the man was stationary\\n\\nthe rascal is listening on the other side of the car from which the two\\nmen are taking out the cases nick said to himself after briefly\\nwatching what little he could see of the motionless figure the\\nopposite door must be closed and his presence is not suspected he hopes\\nto hear gilbert and the truckman discussing what occurred in the\\nwaldmere residence this morning and what i said about the robbery\\notherwise he would not be standing there like a lay figure in a shop\\nwindow ill have a closer look at him for a starter\\n\\npassing around the trains under which he had been gazing nick speedily\\nreached a position from which he could view the suspect\\n\\nhe was not the type of man the detective had expected to see he was\\nroughly clad and looked like a ragpicker he had a short iron hook in\\none hand and carried a partly filled burlap bag under his arm\\n\\nhis hair and beard were gray and long his figure bowed and he appeared\\nto be fully seventy years old\\n\\nthis questionable character who had been standing just where the\\ndetective had thought looked up and saw nick just as he appeared beyond\\nthe end of the sidetracked train\\n\\nhe betrayed no fear however no inclination to run away instead he\\nwalked straight toward the detective glancing under the cars and over\\nthe ground as if in search of bits of iron and junk or anything else\\nwith which he could turn a penny\\n\\nhe passed directly by nick with merely an indifferent glance at him as\\nhe might have bestowed upon any of the yard hands and then he ambled on\\nwith unsteady gait and sought the near street\\n\\nnick passed quickly around a string of cars and followed him\\n\\nfloyd himself by jove or i am much mistaken he said to himself\\nthe makeup is a good one but i dont think i can be mistaken in those\\nshifty gray eyes now to prevent his eluding me if he even suspects my\\nidentity\\n\\nthere seemed to be no probability of the last without looking back\\nwalking as slowly and feebly as if really bowed with years pausing at\\nintervals to peer into a rubbish barrel he was passing or to prod into\\nit with his iron hookthus the man proceeded toward the east side with\\nthe detective cautiously following\\n\\nnick knew the district tolerably well at which his quarry finally\\nbrought up knew it to be one of the worst in the city he was somewhat\\nsurprised that floyd if he had not mistaken his identity was seeking\\nsuch a locality for he had been in the past a man of good taste and\\nfastidious habits\\n\\nnevertheless constantly watching him nick saw the man turn suddenly\\nfrom the street and disappear between two old storage buildings\\n\\nnick was not in a mood to be given the slip nor to stand upon ceremony\\nif threatened with anything of that kind\\n\\nhe had deferred arresting the man only with a view to trailing him until\\nhe could discover his confederates as well as the hiding place of the\\nstolen plate\\n\\nwalking more rapidly therefore nick quickly arrived at the alley into\\nwhich his quarry had disappeared\\n\\nstill he could not discover him the alley ran through to a more open\\narea in which there were several old sheds and hovels beyond them was\\na small square stone building of only two low stories and having a flat\\nroof its few narrow windows were protected with iron shutters all of\\nwhich were closed and secured the general appearance of the building\\ndenoted that it once had been used for storing explosives of some kind\\nbefore municipal regulations prohibited it\\n\\nit then appeared to be unoccupied and out of use however and directly\\nbeyond it loomed the blank windowless brick wall of a brewery fronting\\non the next street\\n\\nnick lost no time in picking his way through the narrow alley even\\nthen he could not at first discover his man passing quickly around two\\nof the sheds mentioned however he then saw him in a small wooden\\nbuilding near the stone structure described\\n\\nthe door of it was wide open and the man was seated on a low stool\\nwithin engaged in pulling a quantity of rags from his burlap bag and\\ntossing them upon a rag heap in one corner\\n\\nfor the first time in view of all this nick began to fear that he had\\nmistaken the mans identity this seemed even more probable in that he\\ndid not appear disturbed by the approach of the detective merely\\nlooking up with a questioning stare when he paused at the open door\\n\\nhows the rag business old man nick inquired a bit bluntly\\n\\nbadvair bad was the reply with a cracked and cackling voice\\n\\nlittle doing eh\\n\\nvair liddle nodding at all\\n\\nis this where you store your stuff questioned nick stepping inside\\nthe low building\\n\\nven i have anyding to store\\n\\nhow long have you been here\\n\\nvell not long i just game in\\n\\nhow long i mean have you had this place for your business\\n\\nvat is it to you came the question with a sharper scrutiny vat for\\nyou vish to know\\n\\nmerely from curiosity said nick drawing nearer to him i saw you in\\nthe railway yard a short time ago didnt i\\n\\ni vas dere nodded the man you have eyes mebbe you might have saw\\nme\\n\\nnick laughed a bit grimly\\n\\ni saw you all right he replied with rather ominous intonation do\\nyou go there after rags\\n\\njunk was the terse rejoinder\\n\\nthat all\\n\\nvat all questioned the man looking up sharply vat for do you care\\nvy i go dere\\n\\nmerely from curiosity nick repeated\\n\\nvell you vas better pocket your curiosity snapped the other\\njunkthats vat i said\\n\\ni heard you\\n\\nfor vat else would i go dere\\n\\nthats what i want to know nick said more sternly\\n\\nvell you dake it out in vanting\\n\\nsee here old man this hair of yours dont appear quite\\n\\nnick broke off abruptly\\n\\nhe had reached down while speaking and seized the mans soiled woolen\\ncap and mop of gray hair giving them a violent jerk\\n\\nthey came away in his hand while the gray beard of the bowed rascal was\\ntorn out of place\\n\\nthe result was precisely what the detective had expected\\n\\nthe removal of the disguise revealed the pallid face and distorted\\nfeatures of the knave who had threatened him in madison avenue only a\\nfew days before those of stuart floyd\\n\\nfloyd evidently was expecting no less\\n\\nin reality he appeared to have planned for it like a flash lurching\\nforward from his stool while nick was speaking he suddenly threw both\\narms with viselike clutch around the detectives legs at the same time\\nshouting with frantic ferocity\\n\\nnow boys quick get him get him get him\\n\\nnick carter hardly knew where they came from they came so quicklythe\\nthree ruffians who rushed into the place\\n\\ntwo were powerful fellows in the neighborhood of forty both armed with\\nheavy bludgeons that they meant business moreover and were out for\\nbloodshed or murder even if it became necessary was speedily\\napparent\\n\\nnick realized on the instant that he had walked into a trap an ambush\\nfrom which escape would not be easy\\n\\nhe reached for his revolver bent upon putting up the fight of his life\\nbut he could not draw the weapon\\n\\nfor the frantic rascal on the floor fiercely clutching nicks legs was\\nwriggling to and fro so furiously that the detective was nearly thrown\\nfrom his feet\\n\\nall the while though the entire episode transpired in less than a\\nquarter minute floyd was fiercely repeating\\n\\nget him boys get him get him get him\\n\\nthere was absolutely no occasion for these sanguinary commands\\n\\nfor the ruffians who had entered instantly attacked the swaying\\ndetective from behind they fell upon him like wolves upon a wounded\\nstag\\n\\nblow followed blow in quick succession with merciless force until nick\\nsank dazed and bleeding upon the floor scarce conscious of what\\nafterward transpired\\n\\nin a vague way however as one senses such things in a dream or a\\nhideous nightmare nick knew that he was being hurriedly bound and\\nrobbed of his revolvers he heard the brutal voices of his assailants\\nbut they sounded faint to him and far away\\n\\nhe knew in a dazed way that the great heap of rags was hurriedly\\npushed aside that a trapdoor which they had concealed was quickly\\nopened and that he then was hurriedly carried down several low steps\\nand through a dark earthysmelling passage then up other steps and\\ninto a stonewalled room lighted only by the feeble rays of an oil lamp\\n\\nthen the cobwebs began to clear from his battered head\\n\\nhe heard floyds hard voice more distinctly as harsh and hard as nails\\nhe could see the faces of his assailants more plainly the two brutal\\nruffians and the third none other than bug bannon\\n\\nget out bagley and close the shed door floyd then was commanding\\nyou slip out bannon and make sure no other dicks are around and that\\nnone else is wise to this rope him to that ring in the wall gorman\\nhands behind him and be sure that hes tied fast\\n\\nleave that to me growled the ruffian\\n\\ni told him id get him floyd added in fierce exultation i warned\\nhim damn him to beware of the melting pot i warned him i told him\\nid get himand curse him now ive got him\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe melting pot\\n\\n\\nnick carter never forgot the scene at which he helplessly gazed later\\nthat evening\\n\\nhe was seated on a bare earth floor within four grim stone walls to an\\niron ring in one of which he was securely bound\\n\\ntwo narrow windows in the side walls were closed with tightfitting iron\\nshutters precluding the escape of a ray of light from within\\n\\nthe ceiling was crossed with great faded beams between which could be\\nseen the chinks of a square trapdoor showing that there was a room\\nabove a narrow wooden stairway in one corner led up to it\\n\\nin one of the end walls was a door covered with sheet iron closed and\\nsecurely locked near by was an excavation leading into the narrow\\nunderground passage through which nick had been carried by his\\nassailants and which evidently had been quite recently made from the\\nrag shed to this secret refuge of the outlaws into whose hands the\\ndetective had fallen\\n\\nin a pile at one side of the room were numerous articles in cloth\\nwrappings some of which were partly displaced through these could be\\nseen the glitter of yellow metal and the dull luster of tarnished\\nsilver\\n\\nobviously these parcels had been brought there secretly and separately\\nor a few at a time by the thieves then in possession of them\\n\\nthere could be no mistaking what all this wasthe contents of the three\\nstolen casesthe valuable waldmere plate\\n\\nin a temporary brick structure in the middle of the earth floor a coal\\nfire was fiercely burning forced by a bellows thrust through the low\\nbrickwork\\n\\nabove it suspended from an iron frame hung a heavy caldron with a\\nlong ladle in itand a quantity of silverware that was being rapidly\\nmelted\\n\\nin the earth floor near one of the walls were numerous rectangular\\nholes molds for receiving the melted metal and from some of which the\\nsilver ingots already had been pulled with an iron hook to make room\\nfor more of the costly fluid\\n\\nthe room was almost as hot as an oven and perspiration stood in great\\ndrops on the faces of the three men then at work therefloyd bagley\\nand gorman\\n\\nnick carter had been sternly watching them for some time he had found\\nthat he had solved more than the mystery of the stolen waldmere plate\\n\\nhe had known for weeks of numerous plate robberies from the dwellings of\\nwealthy suburban residents till it had become a question in the minds\\nof the police as to who were committing the crimes and how so much plate\\nwas disposed of successfully\\n\\nit no longer was a question in nick carters mind he knew now that he\\nwas in the secret quarters of the gang and where floyd had been and how\\nemployed since the looting of the imperial loan company\\n\\ngo up gorman and open that trapdoor floyd suddenly commanded\\nwiping his dripping face and glancing up at the ceiling then some of\\nthis infernal heat will go into the loft\\n\\nso twill nodded gorman red and glowing weve forgotten that\\n\\nhe hastened up the stairway to obey and nick presently saw the square\\ntrapdoor raised and laid over on the upper floor\\n\\ngorman leered down at him for a moment before returning\\n\\nnick ignored him however but then said to floyd resuming a\\nconversation that had ended when the miscreants began the work now\\nengaging them\\n\\nyoull suffer more heat than this floyd for this nights work take\\nmy word for that\\n\\nnot in this world floyd replied with a sneer\\n\\nno in the next\\n\\nim not going that way just now\\n\\nyoull go sooner or later\\n\\nill take chances on the heating system carter all the same floyd\\nsaid scornfully ill get none the worst of it because of anything you\\nhave accomplished\\n\\ndont be so sure of that\\n\\nrats weve got safely away with stuff as i gave you a hint when i\\nlast saw you weve got you too as i warned you all this ought to\\nconvince you carter that im not to be easily cornered\\n\\nnor am i easily convinced on so doubtful a point youll get yours in\\ntime nick sternly predicted\\n\\nyou already are getting yours floyd retorted laughing derisively\\n\\nperhaps\\n\\ni warned you that id get you for having put me to the bad you thought\\nyou were keen and clever when you picked me up in the railway yard you\\npicked up a live wire\\n\\nvery well\\n\\nwhy you bonehead did you think i would not anticipate your seeking me\\nthere i knew you would get after me in that way i went there only to\\ntrap you\\n\\nthat now appears quite obvious nick said dryly\\n\\ni knew that you would recognize me and follow me floyd went on with\\nmalicious satisfaction i had the trap all laid you are a fall guy\\ncarter all right i knew youd walk into it\\n\\nit has not occurred to you perhaps that i did so with open eyes\\nnick said pointedly\\n\\nbunk sneered floyd tell that to the marines why would you have\\ndone that\\n\\nmerely to get a line on you rascals\\n\\nat the risk of your life eh\\n\\ncertainly thats not uncommon said nick\\n\\nrot floyd glared at him doubtfully if you walked into it with your\\neyes open carter well make mighty sure to close them for you youll\\nkeep them closed too take my word for that\\n\\nlet it go at that then nick said indifferently\\n\\nall the while in grim amusement over this colloquy gorman and bagley\\ncontinued their work of melting the silver plate and pouring it into the\\nearth molds\\n\\nthe seething caldron glowed with the heat\\n\\nthe fire burned intensely under it forced by the wheezy bellows\\n\\nit was like a scene in the infernal regions\\n\\nthe melting pot was getting in its work\\n\\nfloyd appeared to be making good\\n\\nseeing him tear the cloth wrapping from a magnificent piece of gold\\nplate superbly embossed and engraved nick frowned more darkly and\\nasked\\n\\nare you going to melt all of that gold plate floyd\\n\\nyou can bet im going to melt it\\n\\nthats a sacrilege\\n\\ncall it what you like\\n\\nsuch plate could not be replaced in these days that was the work of\\nsome of the finest goldsmiths in europe you can do better than melt it\\nfloyd nick earnestly protested anxious to save the fine old plate\\nfrom destruction if possible\\n\\nhow better questioned floyd curiously\\n\\nby selling it back to waldmere said nick he would pay thrice the\\nintrinsic value of the metal\\n\\nthink he would eh\\n\\ni am sure of it\\n\\nthats a good scheme then no doubt\\n\\nyou had better adopt it and save the plate\\n\\nmebbe i had carter but ill do nothing of the kind the risk is too\\ngreat\\n\\ndont let that deter you nick insisted a man as clever as you could\\nsafely make the deal and realize what the stuff is worth youd get by\\nall right\\n\\nill get by carter and you can bank on it floyd asserted\\nconfidently but i shall stick to the safe road ill put this stuff\\ninto shape that can be easily turned into cash it will pay us\\nhandsomely enough all right he added with an exultant leer\\n\\nthats no pipe dream growled bagley with eyes glowing it beats any\\nstuff of the kind that i ever lamped it ought to bring\\n\\nhe broke off abruptly when a low peculiar whistle fell upon his ears\\nthough instantly recognized he instinctively reached for his revolver\\n\\nits bannon snapped floyd quickly bannon or vera\\n\\nsure put in gorman gazing\\n\\nthis was verified in a moment by the appearance of bannon from the\\ntunnel leading from the rag shed\\n\\nhe came out of the ground like an imp out of hades with an evil gleam\\nin his narrow eyes and obviously in some excitement\\n\\nsay floyd ive been up against it he cried at once ive been\\ndoublecrossed by a scurvy whelp who would have thrown us all down and\\ninto the hands of the dicks\\n\\nwhom do you mean floyd demanded staring at him\\n\\npilot flynn\\n\\nthat cur\\n\\ngee wait till i get back at him bannon fiercely threatened ill\\npepper him as full of holes as a sieve\\n\\nwhat do you mean snapped floyd tell me\\n\\nbannon hastened to do so describing the subterfuge of patsy garvan and\\nstating what had followed\\n\\nit brought a murderous light into floyds eyes while uglier scowls\\nsettled on the sweaty faces of gorman and bagley\\n\\nnick carter listened with some misgivings also though he still felt\\nquite that patsy would yet contrive to accomplish what he had\\nundertaken\\n\\nbut what led you to suspect floyd questioned what put you wise to\\nthe game\\n\\ni wasnt wise only suspicious and i knocked him out to make sure\\nbannon quickly explained i made sure too all right\\n\\nhow so\\n\\nheres his barker and a pair of bracelets said bannon producing\\nthem i knew his mug all right after i had downed him hes one of\\nthis dicks push his name is patsy garvan\\n\\nfloyd swung around and glared at the detective\\n\\nwhat do you know about this carter he demanded\\n\\nim not telling all i know nick bluntly answered\\n\\nyoure not eh\\n\\nnot is right\\n\\nby heaven ill find a way to make you floyd harshly threatened im\\ngoing to find out just where we stand or\\n\\neasy bannon turned like a flash then added quickly oh its only\\nthe skirt its vera\\n\\nshe came by the same way as bannon with her skirts drawn around her to\\navoid the earthy walls and with a look of alarm in her evil black eyes\\n\\nwhos the stiff in the alley she asked abruptly with a startled\\nglance at the detective\\n\\nstill there is he floyd quickly questioned instead of explaining\\n\\nyes\\n\\nhell lie still for some time to come bannon viciously predicted i\\ngave it to him good and strong\\n\\nand ill see that you get yours in return thought nick far from\\ndaunted by his own threatening situation\\n\\nyou ought to have downed him earlier farther from here said floyd\\ndoubtfully shaking his head\\n\\nwhy so\\n\\nhe may get wise\\n\\nrats sneered bannon curtly what can he make of it he dont know\\nwhy i came this way nor which way i went after dropping him hell get\\nfat trying to trail me from where i left him\\n\\nwell whats on your mind asked floyd turning to the woman again to\\nwhom bagley had hurriedly explained the situation have you seen the\\ngirl as you planned\\n\\nwant it in his hearing questioned vera with another glance at nick\\n\\nwhy not snapped floyd he cuts no ice now that we have him where we\\nwant him well finish him along with this other good work before\\nmorning\\n\\nthat will be the safest way nick coolly advised\\n\\nleave that to us\\n\\nthats what i am doingunder protest\\n\\nhave you seen the girl floyd repeated again turning to vera vantoon\\n\\nsure ive seen her vera nodded\\n\\nwere you expected\\n\\nthats what i can always bank on angel face\\n\\nangel face thought nick with a quick thrill of satisfaction she\\nrefers to minerva grand as sure as im a foot high things are looking\\nup its money to marbles that chick shadowed the girl then dropped her\\nto follow this woman he would not have forgotten her and her past\\nrelations with stuart floyd he cannot be far from here therell be\\nsomething doing presently that will give these rascals the surprise of\\ntheir lives\\n\\nnick did not for a moment think that chick would have lost sight of this\\nwoman\\n\\nnow replying to floyds inquiry vera vantoon told him of her meeting\\nwith minerva and reported in detail the information the girl had\\nimparted\\n\\nsome of the color faded from floyds face while he listened\\n\\nthose of bug bannon bagley and gorman took on more serious\\nexpressions\\n\\nwhat the devil did he want of hot water and a spoon bannon\\nsuspiciously demanded addressing floyd what kind of a test could he\\nhave wanted to make\\n\\nill be hanged if i know\\n\\nit dont go down not down my throat bannon growled he had some\\nother object he may be putting something over that we dont know\\nabout\\n\\nill darned soon find out cried floyd with eyes blazing what was\\nit carter what was your game\\n\\nyoull not find out from me nick curtly answered\\n\\nwont i\\n\\nnot by a long chalk\\n\\nwell see thundered floyd lifting from the melting pot the ladle\\nhalf filled with liquid silver you answer you tell me out with\\nitor ill pour this down your infernal neck\\n\\nhe meant what he saidand he looked it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndead ashes\\n\\n\\nchick carter whipped out his searchlight crouching above the prostrate\\nman he had found in the alley\\n\\nat the same moment a low moan broke from the victim of bug bannons\\ntreacherous assault patsys head was harder than the cowardly young\\nruffian had thought patsy was fast on his way to reviving\\n\\nthe glare from the searchlight fell on his upturned face and a low cry\\nof dismay came from chick\\n\\ngreat guns he muttered its patsy\\n\\npatsy heard him and the sound of the familiar voice was like a\\nstimulant it brought him completely out of dreamland\\n\\noh its you chick he said faintly gee that was a hard crack on\\nthe beanbut im still in the ring\\n\\nchick heard him with a thrill of relief\\n\\nby jove i thought you were done up patsy he replied raising him to\\na sitting position how are you feeling\\n\\nbetter every second ill be on my pins in a minute\\n\\nwhat happened how did it occur chick inquired\\n\\nit took patsy only a few moments to inform him and for chick to state\\nhow he had discovered vera vantoon and afterward lost sight of her\\nbefore they had finished patsy was on his feet but with a look of\\ndisgust on his rather pale face\\n\\nhang it then weve lost both of them he said dubiously whats to\\nbe done the chief may be in dead wrong by this time\\n\\nthe fact that both of them vanished in this locality is significant\\nchick replied if only one had come here i might think nothing of it\\nunder the circumstances however its ten to one that the gang has\\nquarters in this section\\n\\ngee theres something in that said patsy quick to see the point\\nin one of these old buildings perhaps\\n\\nare you fit for a search asked chick still a bit anxious\\n\\nas fit as a fiddle patsy assured him\\n\\ntake one of my revolvers then said chick giving it to him we may\\nrun foul of some one\\n\\nill be ready for him i hope it may be that whelp that downed me i\\ncan see where hed get his\\n\\nchick laughed softly\\n\\ncome on he muttered leading the way well steal through the alley\\nand have a look at the back of these buildings\\n\\npatsy followed him\\n\\nfor something like five minutes they searched cautiously and noiselessly\\nback of the gloomy buildings and between the sheds and hovels but could\\nfind in the darkness no trace of the vanished rascals no clew to their\\nwhereabouts\\n\\nthey then had brought up near the rag shed in which nick had found the\\ndisguised crook and some twenty yards from the grim and gloomshrouded\\nstone building\\n\\ngee this dont look good to me patsy whispered at chicks elbow\\nthey sure have given us the slip\\n\\nit does look so chick quietly admitted\\n\\nthere isnt a sign of light from any of these miserable cribs it ought\\nto find its way out through some chink or nail hole if they are under\\ncover in any of them\\n\\ntrue\\n\\nwe had better\\n\\nhush stop a bit\\n\\nwhat now patsy whispered noting the changed expression on chicks\\nface\\n\\ntheres something doing\\n\\nwhat do you mean\\n\\nlook there\\n\\nchick pointed to the stone building not to its grim walls and black\\nwindows from which not a twinkle of light could be seenbut higher to\\na point above its low flat roof\\n\\nin the middle of it was a scuttle and glass skylightand stuart floyd\\nhad made one mistake that was to bring disaster\\n\\nin opening the trapdoor in the ceiling which was nearly directly above\\nthe melting pot he had forgotten the skylight in a line with the\\ntrapdoor\\n\\nchick and patsy had not till then looked up in that direction for a\\nclew\\n\\nnow however both could see the faint glow that came up from below and\\nstood out in relief as it were against the surrounding night gloom\\n\\nit was like the glow shed out from the open door of a brightly lighted\\nhall\\n\\nholy smoke patsy muttered with a quick thrill theres some one in\\nthe old stone crib\\n\\nmore than one patsy i suspect chick whispered\\n\\ncan we get in\\n\\nwait here while i have a look\\n\\ngo ahead\\n\\nchick glided away in the darkness presently returning\\n\\ni dont think we can get in on the ground floor he said quietly the\\ndoor and window shutters are of sheet iron and all are securely\\nclosed\\n\\ngee that sure smacks of something doing\\n\\nim convinced of it now\\n\\ncould you hear anything from inside\\n\\nnot a sound said chick there is a way however by which we can\\nlook in\\n\\nyou mean\\n\\nchick pointed toward the roof\\n\\ntheres a skylight he said quietly\\n\\nmust be patsy tersely agreed but how can we get up there\\n\\nits not more than eighteen feet to the edge of the roof i climbed\\nover several planks back here that are that long\\n\\ngee whiz exclaimed patsy elated ive got you we can lean one of\\nthe planks against the rear wall and get up there by means of it\\n\\neasily\\n\\nwell not be heard either through that stone wall\\n\\nnot if we are careful\\n\\ncome on whispered patsy impatiently lets get the plank\\n\\nit did not take them long to find one that would serve their purpose\\nnor to lug it to the rear of the low building and place at an angle\\nagainst the stone wall it reached within a foot of the edge of the\\nroof and that was more than ample\\n\\nshoes off patsy whispered chick\\n\\nboth were ready within half a minute\\n\\nin another minute both were crouching on the roof\\n\\nnoiselessly they crept to the skylight and gazed down through the\\ntrapdoor on the redglowing scene below\\n\\nthundering guns whispered patsy staring the rats are there all\\nright they are melting a lot of silver plate\\n\\npart of the waldmere plate\\n\\nsurest thing you know\\n\\nthey could not see nick owing to the location of the trap in the upper\\nfloor but while listening intentlythey heard him addressed by floyd\\nand his name mentioned\\n\\nholy smoke patsy then whispered theyve got the chief\\n\\ni heard chick nodded feeling over the skylight\\n\\nhadnt we better get help and force an entrance\\n\\nfloyd might send a bullet into nick in that case before he could be\\nprevented theres a better way\\n\\nwhat way\\n\\nchick held up one of the small panes of the skylight he had found the\\nputty dry and crumbling and after a moment he had quietly removed the\\npane feeling through the opening he then found that he could release\\nthe hook that secured the scuttle\\n\\nthat upper floor is less than seven feet below the skylight he\\nwhispered we can let ourselves down to it without a drop the noise\\ndown there will prevent our being heard providing we are careful there\\nmust be a stairway to the lower floor we can steal down and hold up the\\nwhole gang\\n\\npatsy nodded his approval\\n\\nbetter way is right he murmured it looks like soft walking\\n\\nit will enable us to protect nick also\\n\\nthats the stuff safety first\\n\\nare you ready\\n\\nready as a trivet\\n\\nworking cautiously and deliberately chick succeeded in lifting the\\nskylight without making a sound and he laid it over on the roof\\n\\nill go first patsy he murmured\\n\\npatsy merely nodded\\n\\nchick let himself over the sill then grasped the frame of the scuttle\\nand lowered himself till his feet touched the floor some eighteen inches\\nfrom the trapdoor\\n\\npatsy followed him\\n\\nthe scene below was indeed one that diverted the attention of the\\ncrooks from anything overhead\\n\\nit was at that very moment that stuart floyd fiercely threatening the\\ndetective had seized the ladle of liquid silver from the melting pot\\nand was approaching with the evident intention of making good his\\ninfamous threat\\n\\nchick carter did not give him time to do so\\n\\nhis revolver was out on the instant and its report rang like thunder\\nabove all other sounds\\n\\nfloyd went to the floor with a bullet in his shoulder and the ladle\\nfell from his lax hand\\n\\nchick dropped to the edge of the trapdoor and thrust the smoking weapon\\nthrough it\\n\\nhands up he yelled fiercely up with them hell be a dead man who\\nstirs\\n\\npatsy had darted toward the dimly lighted stairway and already was\\nnearly down\\n\\ndead man is right he shouted weapon leveled move foot or finger\\nman or woman and ill shoot to kill\\n\\nwithout exception the several crooks had knuckled to the sudden\\nstartling situation as a matter of fact they supposed the building was\\nsurrounded and that a posse of police were breaking in on them once\\ntheir hands were up however it was all over but the shouting as patsy\\nafterward said\\n\\nwithin five minutes the crooks were secured floyd among them he having\\nsuffered only a flesh wound\\n\\nhalf an hour later all were in the tombs including minerva grand the\\nfirst step toward the punishment they deserved\\n\\nmidnight saw the priceless plate or that most cherished by waldmere\\ntaken safely into his residenceand thus crowning with complete\\nsuccess the splendid work of nick carter and his assistants the\\nsensational case ended\\n\\nthe fire under the melting pot had become dead ashes\\n\\n\\nthe end\\n\\nnotwithstanding the fact that floyd and his gang had apparently been\\nrounded up nick carter and his associates were to have yet more trouble\\nwith this gang of blackmailers crooks and thieves you will learn\\nabout these later developments in the duplicate night or nick\\ncarters double reflection which you will find in the next issue no\\n of the nick carter stories out may d then too there will be\\nthe usual installment of the serial together with other special\\narticles which you will enjoy\\n\\n\\nturn to the jury sir\\n\\n\\nsome years ago a witness was being examined in a case of slander when\\nthe judge required him to repeat the precise words spoken\\n\\nthe witness hesitated until he riveted the attention of the whole court\\nupon him then fixing his eyes earnestly on the judge began\\n\\nmay it please your honor you lie and steal and get your living by\\nstealing\\n\\nthe face of the judge reddened and he immediately exclaimed\\n\\nturn to the jury sir\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwheres the commandant\\n\\nby c c waddell\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe glint in the darkness\\n\\n\\ncolonel vedant and his adjutant captain ormsby grail hurried down to\\nthe dolliver foundry one of the large industrial plants along\\nbrantfords bustling seven miles of water front in response to an\\nurgent message from otto schilder manager of the plant it was ten\\noclock at night but as the dolliver people were turning out some\\ncastings for a wireless telegraph mast of new design to be erected at\\nfort denton and required frequent consultations with the commandant\\nthere seemed nothing especially strange in the request\\n\\non the arrival of the officers however they learned to their\\nsurprise that there was no desire for the colonels presence and the\\nmanager flatly disclaimed having sent for him the old soldier stared\\nincredulously his somewhat florid face taking on a deeper flush behind\\nhis gray military mustache\\n\\npardon me mr schilderhe made little effort to conceal his\\nirritationbut do i understand you to say that it would have been\\nimpossible for any such message to be sent me from the foundry this\\nevening\\n\\nthe manager removed his cigar and rose from his desk to face the other\\n\\npositively so colonel he spoke emphatically and with a slight\\ngerman accent there has been nobody in the office since six oclock\\nexcept myself and miss griffinwith a wave of the hand toward his\\nstenographerand we have been wholly engrossed in making up some\\narrears in correspondence\\n\\nyou hear grail the colonel turned toward his adjutant are you\\nresponsible for this blunder got the name twisted or something of that\\nsort eh\\n\\nhardly sir the younger officer appeared no less perplexed than his\\nsuperior but his tone was one of firm conviction the note was written\\non a letterhead of the dolliver foundry and was ostensibly from mr\\nschilder i am familiar with his signature as to the contents i could\\nnot well have been mistaken you remember i read the message over to\\nyou twice the contents make small difference anyhow since mr\\nschilder denies having sent us a communication of any sort\\n\\nsmall difference admitted the colonel except as offering a possible\\nclew to the perpetrator of this hoax for it cannot well be anything\\nelse unless indeed he paused abruptly the umbrage he had shown\\ngiving way to something like concern come captain he addressed his\\ncompanion a trifle peremptorily at the same time backing toward the\\ndoor we are detaining mr schilder permit us to apologize for the\\ninterruption sir and let us\\n\\nat this point a remarkable thing happened the electric lights went\\nout cutting short the colonels apology and shrouding not only the\\noffice but the foundry yard outside in darkness\\n\\nfor a moment grail was absolutely blinded then as his vision cleared\\nand the square of the open doorway became faintly visible he saw cut\\nacross it a tiny flash of fire like the glow of a lightning bug in\\nflight no other sight or sound punctuated the interval and almost\\nimmediately the lights came on again\\n\\nah schilder blinked before the sudden radiance the dynamo must have\\nslipped a belt or he halted with a little gasp why he\\nexclaimed what has become of the colonel\\n\\nit was certainly astonishing not one of the three other occupants of\\nthe room had stirred grail and the manager stood in exactly the same\\nposition as before and the stenographer still sat at her table with her\\nfingers resting on the keys of her typewriter but the colonel was gone\\n\\nwith a common impulse the two men stepped swiftly to the door and\\nglanced out across the yard there had not been sufficient time for any\\none to cross it and reach the gate yet the colonel was nowhere to be\\nseen and his erect soldierly figure could not possibly have gone\\nunrecognized in that wideopen space and under the glare of the half\\ndozen or more arc lamps now brightly burning nor could there be any\\nquestion of his having strayed from the direct path in the darkness and\\nbeing now hidden from their view by a pile of rubbish or material for\\nthe inclosure was remarkably free from obstruction indeed the last of\\nwhat had been a towering scrap heap was being cleaned up and with the\\naid of an electric crane loaded on cars by the force of men then at\\nwork\\n\\nwell what do you know about that schilder muttered then closely\\nfollowed by grail he hurried across the yard to interrogate the old\\nwatchman at the gate but the latter was firm in his protestation that\\nno one had passed him even with the yard lights all out he could\\nstill he declared have seen anybody leaving the place by the\\nillumination from the street lamp on the corner\\n\\nthen said grail he must have gone out some other way\\n\\nthe manager waved his hand significantly toward the high board fence\\nwhich completely surrounded the yard and which was topped with sharp\\nspikes to keep out pilferers there was but one exitthe gate at which\\nthey had already made inquiry the big doors leading into the foundry\\nbuilding were barred and padlocked\\n\\nperhaps he is still in the office ventured grail he might have had\\na seizure of some kind in the darkness you know and fallen behind a\\npiece of furniture\\n\\nbut even as he voiced the suggestion he realized its utter absurdity\\nschilders office contained nothing except the desk which could have\\nconcealed the body of a man and the desk was pushed back close against\\nthe wall nevertheless they made an inspection of the place but\\nentirely without result then when the manager called in every man\\nworking in the yard and questioned him to no purpose the searchers\\nseemed to have come to the end of their tether\\n\\nbut it is preposterous you know exclaimed grail attempting to throw\\noff his misgivings there is of course some absolutely simple\\nexplanation and the colonel is no doubt out at the post by this time\\nswearing about me for not putting in an appearance may i use your\\ntelephone mr schilder\\n\\ninquiry at the fort elicited that colonel vedant had not returned and\\nno information regarding him could be gained from his quarters the\\nclub or any of his customary haunts when grail had gone through the\\nentire list and called up the post again only to receive the same\\nnegative answer he made no effort to conceal his growing anxiety a\\nsuspicion of foul play strengthened in his mind if not that he\\nasked why should the colonel of his own accord disappear in this\\nabsurdly mysterious manner colonel vedant is not the sort of man to be\\nwaylaid or carried off without making at least a show of resistance and\\ni certainly heard no outcry or sound of a struggle did you\\n\\nschilder shook his head no no theres nothing in that he said\\nimpatiently how please tell me could such a scheme have been planned\\nin advance and put into effect when we allow no strangers hanging\\naround here under any pretext but overlooking all that he argued\\nand even granting that the old gentleman might have been knocked out by\\nthe sudden silent blow of a blackjack or sandbag how was he so quickly\\nspirited away the lights were out hardly more than long enough for one\\nto draw a deep breathsurely not a sufficient time to get farther than\\nten or twelve steps from the door is it possible that with all those\\nyard lights going again the colonel could have been dragged or carried\\nthe length of the inclosure and none of the men at work out there have\\nnoticed it\\n\\ngrail made no immediate answer he stepped to the door and leaning\\nover narrowly inspected the cindercovered ground about the threshold\\nbut no marks or footprints indicating a struggle rewarded his searching\\ngaze the surface was absolutely undisturbed then all at once he\\nespied a foot or two away a small object he glanced back over his\\nshoulder and seeing that schilder had turned to address a word of\\ndirection to the stenographer reached out and quickly transferred it to\\nhis pocket\\n\\nit was a halfsmoked cigarettea cigarette of dullgray paper with a\\npeculiar long pasteboard mouthpiece\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe clew that failed\\n\\n\\ntheres no need to keep you any longer miss griffin schilder said to\\nthe stenographer as grail came back toward him andermiss griffin\\ni guess it would be just as well if you didnt mention this occurrence\\nto any one on the outside we want no unnecessary notoriety eh\\ncaptain\\n\\nthe adjutant agreed with him if you dont mind though mr schilder\\nhe said and if miss griffin will oblige me id like to have her take\\ndown a note for me to major appleby this matter ought to be reported to\\nhim at once and i dont like to use the telephone it will be very\\nbrief miss griffin he continued turning to the girl you can take\\nit direct on the machine only i will ask you to give me a carbon copy\\nwe have to be very particular in the army in regard to all\\ncommunications you know\\n\\nthen when she had slipped in her sheets of paper and sat ready at her\\ntypewriter he swung around so as to face schilder and crisply\\ndictated\\n\\nplease come at once on receipt of this to the office of the dolliver\\nfoundry as i desire to confer with you on a matter of the greatest\\nimportance\\n\\nhis eyes never for a moment left schilders face while the message was\\nbeing transcribed but if he had expected to see anything there he was\\ndoomed to disappointment the countenance of the manager remained as\\nexpressionless as a mask\\n\\nwhat do you think of that grail finally asked him\\n\\nwellthe other man was lighting a cigarit certainly seems urgent\\nenough\\n\\nyes said grail dryly except for the address and signature it is\\nword for word the same as the note received by colonel vedant\\n\\nah thank you miss griffin he added as he took the two sheets of\\npaper which she handed him and signing the original slipped it into\\nan envelope im going to ask you too if you dont mind to stop at\\nthe a d t office on your way to the car and have them rush this\\nright out to the fort\\n\\nafter this nothing more was said until the girl had donned her hat and\\njacket and taken her departure grail thoughtfully folded up and put\\ninto his pocket the carbon copy which he had been studying meanwhile\\nunder the light at the desk\\n\\ni observe mr schilder he said that the capital d on your\\ntypewriter blurs badly and that the m is slightly chipped on one side\\nit will be interesting to compare this copy with the note received by\\nthe colonel to see if both show the same defects\\n\\nthe manager however merely shrugged his shoulders you still cling to\\nthe idea that the note must have come from here eh well youre on the\\nwrong scent captainentirely on the wrong scent a sheet of our letter\\npaper would be no very difficult thing to get hold of and when you come\\nto look into the matter i think youll find that the original note was\\nwritten at post headquarters\\n\\nat post headquarters what do you mean by that demanded grail\\n\\nmy dear captain schilder answered hasnt it struck you yet that the\\nmost likely person in the world to write that note to colonel vedant\\nwascolonel vedant himself between ourselves nowyou are better\\nacquainted with conditions than iisnt there something which might\\nhave induced the old fellow to drop quietly out of sight\\n\\nah grail spoke slowly so that is your solution is it\\n\\na more plausible one at any rate than to imagine he was kidnaped or\\nsomething of that sort schilder contended it wouldnt have been much\\nof a trick for him to have slipped off his coat so as to look like one\\nof the workmen and then to have dodged through the gate when old dennis\\nwasnt looking men have done such things before captain\\n\\nnot men like colonel vedant grail insisted warmly he is the type\\nthat fights rather than runs away besides in this case there is\\nabsolutely no ground for such a suspicion his record is unassailable\\nand he is due for honorable retirement in a few months he has no\\nfinancial troubles his health for all his fifty odd years is perfect\\nand no one who knows him could doubt his sanity for a moment what\\npossible reason could there be for such a man to chuck the game\\n\\nperhaps a woman suggested schilder\\n\\nrot the only woman the colonel is interested in is his daughter and\\nhe would never do anything to cause her the slightest distress or\\nuneasiness why man on her account alone if for no other reason the\\ntheory you offer is simply ridiculous\\n\\nthere was some further discussion along the same line but of little\\nconsequence shortly after major appleby with a couple of officers\\nfrom the fort arrived in a motor car\\n\\nbless my soul exclaimed the major a short and rather\\napoplecticlooking warrior when the situation had duly been made clear\\nto him we must lose no time in getting to the bottom of this\\n\\nmr schilder remarked grail quietly is firmly convinced that the\\ncolonel took himself off voluntarily\\n\\nnonsense protested major appleby and his companions promptly echoed\\nthe opinion vedant is the last man in the world to have done a thing\\nof that sort\\n\\nall right conceded the manager you gentlemen are probably more\\ncompetent to judge on that point than i just the same i surely am\\ncurious to see what other explanation you can get to fit the facts\\n\\nah the major cocked his head importantly on one side that will no\\ndoubt come out in the investigation the chief thing now is to learn\\njust what the exact facts are\\n\\nthe inquiry he set on foot however elicited nothing new and in the\\nend the newcomers had to confess themselves as completely baffled as\\ngrail and schilder still it did not escape the shrewd eyes of the\\nfoundry manager as the fruitless investigation proceeded that certain\\nmore or less vague suspicions were forming in the minds of appleby and\\nhis associates and he gathered too not so much from anything that was\\nsaid or done as by a sort of coolness in the atmosphere that these were\\nin some way hostile to the adjutant\\n\\na sly smile flickered across his lips under the cover of his beard and\\nwith an air of impatience he broke in on the aimless conjectures of the\\nthree officers\\n\\ncome come gentlemen he said all this amounts to nothing and\\nsince you seem determined to make it a case of foul play i guess i had\\nbetter start to do something on my own hook\\n\\nyou the major glared at him haughtily what have you got to do with\\nit\\n\\nschilder laughed the dolliver foundry can hardly afford my dear sir\\nto have a mystery of this sort taking place on its premises without at\\nleast a show of effort on my part to clear it up delay moreover\\nmerely makes the matter look worse for us so although i dislike\\nneedless notoriety as much as any of the rest of you i instead of\\ncompleting the sentence he reached out for the telephone on his desk\\n\\nwhat are you going to do demanded appleby sharply\\n\\ncall up the chief of police and place the matter in his hands\\n\\nthe chief of police the major gave a violent start and glanced\\nuneasily at his companions only grail seemed unperturbed and the side\\nglance he cast at schilder was distinctly skeptical it was almost as\\nthough he said i dare you to make good your bluff\\n\\nthe major lost no time however in entering a remonstrance\\n\\noh i beg of you mr schilder he urged let us not do anything\\nrash there areercertain matters which i am loath to mention here\\nbut which provided the officers at the fort have sufficient time to\\nsift them out will i am sure bring a speedy solution you bear me out\\nin this do you not gentlemen he appealed to his two companions\\n\\nthey assented and it was noticeable that in doing so both carefully\\navoided looking in the direction of the adjutant\\n\\nschilder a mocking twinkle in his eye turned toward grail\\n\\nand you captain he asked can you give me the same assurance\\n\\nthe young officer met his gaze steadily why not he said to my\\nmind the investigation simply resolves itself into a matter of\\ndetermining the authorship of the note received by the colonel and\\nsurely we at the fort are as competent to handle that as some blundering\\npoliceman\\n\\nmajor appleby gave a grunt of recollection and his manner toward grail\\nrelaxed\\n\\nah yes he said with evident relief i had forgotten for the moment\\nthe existence of that clew the note is at headquarters i presume\\ncaptain\\n\\ngrail nodded i left it on my desk when the colonel and i came away\\n\\nthen come urged the major moving toward the door let us lose no\\ntime in taking a look at it we can trust you i suppose mr schilder\\nto take no action until you hear from us\\n\\nanything in reason major the manager agreed and i certainly hope\\nfor all our sakes that you meet with quick success\\n\\nafter he had returned from seeing the party off in their automobile\\nhowever and had closed his desk for the night he lingered a moment in\\nthe office before taking his departure\\n\\ni wonder he muttered thoughtfully if that man grail is stringing\\nme or am i stringing him\\n\\nmeanwhile as the motor car swiftly left the factory chimneys and\\nslumlike streets of the river front behind and climbed the hilly\\nstreets back toward the fort major appleby turned toward the adjutant\\nwho sat beside him in the tonneau\\n\\nwhat do you make of it all captain he asked in a conciliatory tone\\nyou were on the ground and ought to be able to form a better judgment\\nthan any of the rest of us\\n\\nits gumshoe work grail answered a trick of some of those foreign\\nspies who have been hanging around ever since colonel vedant started on\\nhis present series of experiments they thought no doubt that with a\\nhurry call of this sort they might catch him with some of the papers on\\nhis person\\n\\nthen you believe that schilder is\\n\\ngrail shook his head too obvious he objected whatever else\\nschilder may be he is not a fool\\n\\nbut whom else can we suspect under the circumstances queried\\nappleby have you any theory at all captain that will account for the\\nmystery\\n\\nthe adjutant hesitated a moment i think i will wait to answer those\\nquestions major until after we have examined the colonels note\\n\\nah true assented the other that must naturally be our starting\\npoint and here we are\\n\\nthe automobile turned in from the treeshaded street and sped down the\\nroadway past officers row it halted in front of headquarters and the\\nfour passengers piled hurriedly out grail abstractedly acknowledging\\nthe salute of the soldier on guard pressed forward in the lead and\\nunlocking the door swung it open there was no need to switch on the\\nlights as the room was already sufficiently illuminated by a night bulb\\nwhich hung in front of the safe\\n\\nthe adjutant closely followed by the others advanced to the desk then\\npaused with a little gasp of bewilderment\\n\\nwhy he exclaimed the note is gone i am positive i left it here\\n\\nhe turned to the colonels striker who lounged sleepily in the\\nadjoining room to inquire if any one had been there in his absence\\n\\nnot a soul sir was the answer\\n\\nthen have you yourself been in here or touched any of the papers on\\nthe desk\\n\\nhavent stirred from my seat sir since you and the colonel went\\n\\nthat seemed to settle pretty well the question of outside interference\\nfor with the guard outside and this man seated where he could command\\nthe whole interior of the place no person could have entered\\nundetected yet the note was indubitably gone the drawers of the desk\\nwere ransacked the files gone over even the floor thoroughly searched\\nwithout revealing the slightest trace of it with all the doors and\\nwindows closed there was no chance of it having been carried away by\\nsome frolicsome breeze\\n\\nmajor appleby regarded grail with a portentous frown captain he said\\nstiffly this is very very strange\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunder suspicion\\n\\n\\nthere was little sleep at fort denton that night two oclock found the\\nlights still burning brightly in major applebys quarters where most of\\nthe officers of the post were assembled conspicuous by his absence from\\nthis gathering however was the adjutant captain grail he had been\\nthere at an earlier hour to join in the deliberations but after once\\nmore making a report of the circumstances connected with colonel\\nvedants disappearance he somewhat stiffly withdrew he sensed in the\\nconference that same feeling of doubt and hostility toward him which had\\nmanifested itself in appleby and his companions on first hearing the\\nstory and his selfrespect would not permit him to remain\\n\\nafter his departure a rather uneasy silence settled down on the\\ncouncil a few pointless remarks were made but for the most part the\\ngroup devoted themselves to their cigars and studied the pattern of the\\ncarpet\\n\\nfinally however captain dobbs the surgeona bald bluntspoken old\\nfellowbrought things to an issue\\n\\nwhats the use of mincing matters he boomed glancing defiantly\\naround the circle every man here believes that grails at the bottom\\nof this thing then why not get down to cases instead of sitting around\\nhere like a pack of dummies\\n\\na little gasp partly of relief partly of surprise at such plain\\nspeaking ran around the room and everybody glanced involuntarily\\ntoward major appleby where he sat at the head of the table\\n\\nhm the major cleared his throat and moved a bit uncomfortably under\\nthe scrutiny withoutergoing quite so far as our friend dobbs he\\nfinally ventured cautiously i take it that no one here will deny there\\nis some reason in what he says we must be prudent though gentlemen\\nremember the honor of the army is involved\\n\\nprudent ha the doctor gave a scornful cackle why the whole post\\nhas been like a whispering gallery all afternoon i doubt if theres a\\nman on the reservation from cook boy to colonel who hasnt been\\ncocking his head to one side and asking under his breath what there\\nwas in this business about grail the only person who didnt seem to be\\nwise to it was grail himself now lets cut out all this innuendo and\\ngossip and look the facts squarely in the face if the report thats\\nbeen going around is true its unquestionably got a bearing on the\\naffair were investigating if not the sooner we put a stopper on it\\nand turn our searchlights in another direction the better for all\\nconcerned in either event i guess the honor of the army will take care\\nof itself\\n\\nthere was a murmur of approval as the surgeon finished speaking\\nfollowed by calls from various parts of the room for hemingway and\\neventually in response to these demands a flushed young lieutenant\\nrose rather reluctantly to his feet\\n\\nmr hemingway the major said you seem to be the person best\\nqualified to make a statement in this matter will you therefore\\nrepeat for the benefit of us all the communication which you made in\\nconfidence to mrs appleby and myself this afternoon\\n\\nin confidenceto mrs appleby the doctor snorted scarcely taking\\nthe trouble to lower his voice no wonder it was all over the post in\\nless than half an hour\\n\\nin the general eagerness to hear hemingway however his growling passed\\nunnoticed and the young lieutenant shifting unhappily from one foot to\\nthe other commenced his story\\n\\nin the first place he said glancing appealingly around the circle of\\nofficers and as i told major appleby i dont want any one to think\\nthat ive been up to any sneaking or underhand business but when a\\nthing came right up and slapped me in the face i couldnt help taking\\nnotice of it especially after the colonel told all of us that he wanted\\nus to be on our guard during the course of these experiments\\n\\ncut out the excuses protested one of his auditors its the facts we\\nwant to get at\\n\\nwell then cried hemingway defiantly i say that captain grail has\\nbeen having dealings with sasaku the jap waiter at the mess which are\\nopen to very grave suspicion i am in charge of the mess this month as\\nyou all know and i had noticed that grail seemed to have considerable\\nto say to the jap when he dropped in for his meals but i never attached\\nany importance to the matter until today at noon when i saw him hand\\nsasaku a long envelope which the latter immediately slipped under his\\njacket then i will admit i began to get a little worked up for there\\nwas a certain furtiveness about the transaction which i didnt\\naltogether like so as soon as grail left i promptly nailed sasaku\\nand demanded to know what it was the captain had given him\\n\\nand he lied of course commented a former mess manager out of the\\ndepths of his experience probably told you that you must have been\\nmistaken\\n\\nno returned hemingway he simply informed me coolly that it was none\\nof my business and gave me notice that he was quitting his job\\n\\nwhy didnt you grab the impudent beggar and search him another\\nofficer broke in\\n\\nwellthe lieutenant flushed againi didnt want to make any\\nblunder dont you know so i decided to report the matter first to\\nmajor appleby before taking any definite action and by the time i got\\nback to the mess again the jap had cleared out bag and baggage\\n\\ncleared out where\\n\\nthats the question hemingway shook his head ive had corporal\\nstone and half a dozen men out ransacking the town for him since four\\noclock and not a trace can be found we think he must have sneaked\\naboard a train somehow and got away unless he paused\\n\\nunless major appleby pointedly finished his departure may have some\\nconnection with the far more serious matter of the colonels\\ndisappearance\\n\\nhas any one put this business about the jap up to grail the surgeon\\ninquired with a frown\\n\\nnot directly appleby admitted that is unless the colonel may have\\nmentioned it to him he was really the only one who had an opportunity\\nfor grail left the post shortly after the occurrence and did not return\\nuntil nine oclock and from that time until they set out for the\\nfoundry the two were closeted together in the office vedant however\\nwas rather inclined to poohpooh the whole matter and he may very\\neasily have failed to speak\\n\\ncan any one doubt though that grail knew what was in the wind\\ndemanded young hemingway hotly why the very way he left us here\\ntonight showed it i say too he insisted that a man whod been\\ncaught selling secrets to a japanese spy and saw courtmartial looming\\nup ahead of him couldnt well think of a smoother plan to sidetrack\\ninquiry and shift attention from himself than to have the colonel\\nabducted\\n\\nbut that would indicate that this fellow schilder was in on the deal\\ntoo objected one of the officers who had not yet spoken and what\\ninterest could he\\n\\nschilder pshaw he was only a convenient tool interrupted hemingway\\nbelieve me hes as much in the dark as anybody else\\n\\nhow could the game have been worked without his connivance though\\ninquired the other\\n\\nhumph trust a pack of slick japanese to handle that all right\\nhemingway gave a toss of the head knowing the colonels movements in\\nadvance what would have been easier than for them to secret themselves\\nabout the foundry yard then at the psychological moment cut off the\\nlights and rush the colonel out and away with their agility and\\ncunning a trick like that would be simply pie to them\\n\\nhow do you explain this business about the note from schilder though\\nbroke in another questioner you think of course that grail or the\\njap forged the note that was received but if so why doesnt grail\\nshow it up now instead of making things look worse for himself with the\\nassertion that it has disappeared\\n\\nah that was the smoothest part of the whole deal declared the\\nyouthful investigator he knew that he was bound to be suspected\\ndidnt he and he knew too that documentary evidence of that sort\\nsubjected to such close examination as would naturally be given it\\nmight lead to his detection so what does he do but get it out of the\\nway and at the same time fog the issue with another touch of apparent\\nmystery\\n\\nhis emphatic arguments began to carry weight with the rest it was at\\nleast a solution that he offered and groping about in the dark as they\\nwere they were ready to accept almost any theory that bore the color of\\nplausibility\\n\\ni think said dobbs the surgeon voicing a general sentiment its\\nabout time for us to put this matter up to grail straight and see what\\nhe has to say for himself\\n\\nthe major summoned his striker my compliments to adjutant grail and\\nask him if he can make it convenient to come here at once to answer a\\nfew questions\\n\\nin less than five minutes the messenger was back with the astonishing\\nreply\\n\\nthe adjutants compliments sir and he wishes to know if you care to\\nput your request in the form of an order if not sir he does not care\\nto discuss anything with the officers tonight\\n\\nthe major grew red with indignation at the injury to his dignity and\\nthe surgeon growled darkly that the answer bore out his suspicions but\\nappleby was not a man of snapshot action and he said with an\\nassumption of chilly dignity\\n\\nvery well say to the adjutant with my compliments that i shall issue\\nno orders tonight then turning to the officers with a portentous\\nshrug he added we will await the developments of tomorrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmysterious ashes\\n\\n\\nafter sending his curt message to major appleby grail sat in the office\\nat headquarters whither he had betaken himself from the meeting\\nsmoking fiercely and glowering at a spot on the wall he had set\\nhimself in defiance of the whole post and he could not but feel that he\\nwas in the right at any rate he scorned to defend himself against the\\naspersions of a blunderer like appleby or an officious young ass like\\nhemingway for as it happened he knew of the story set afloat by the\\nmess manager colonel vedant having detailed it to him jestingly during\\ntheir hurried trip to the foundry grail had been prevented then from\\noffering any explanation owing to their arrival at schilders office\\n\\nrather than make such an explanation now he vowed he would be drawn and\\nquartered for he bitterly resented the attitude taken by his brother\\nofficers their readinessnay almost eagernessto believe the very\\nworst of him\\n\\ngrail loved his profession more than once he had refused flattering\\noffers to leave it for a career in civil life but now in his hot\\nindignation he declared that not another week should find him wearing\\nthe uniform and associating with such doublefaced intriguing cads\\n\\non the impulse of the moment he stepped over to his desk and\\nsnatching up a pen started to write out his resignation but as he\\nblotted the sheet before affixing his signature he paused with an\\nexclamation of annoyance to find that the lines he had written were\\nstreaked with fine gray dust which had fallen on the paper a sort of\\ngritty powder it seemed to be like the dust which rises from the\\nhandling of filed papers or documents without giving the matter second\\nthought grail was about to tear up the blurred resignation and start to\\ndraft another one when his attention was suddenly caught by a flake of\\nthe powder slightly larger than the others\\n\\nit was a tiny shred of paper but what especially aroused his interest\\nwas that it showed the trace of a lithographed letter v of the\\npeculiar style and shading used as a heading by the dolliver foundry\\n\\nquickly he caught up the blotter he had been using and shook it over a\\nsheet of carbon paper for there had flashed into his mind a prompt\\nsuspicion as to the nature of that dust that it had fallen from the\\nblotter there could be no question and he recalled distinctly that he\\nhad left the mysteriously missing note lying on that blotter when he and\\nthe colonel took their hasty departure\\n\\na moment or two gave him all the confirmation of his suspicion that he\\nrequired for under his vigorous shaking there sifted down on the dark\\nsurface several fragments from a sixteenth to a thirtysecond of an\\ninch in diameter on which he could plainly decipher indications of\\ntypewriting\\n\\nsnatching up a reading glass belonging to the colonel he bent over\\nthese to satisfy himself he had made no mistake then straightened up\\nwith a muttered expletive and a little puzzled frown between the eyes\\n\\nthe glass brought out on one of the specks what appeared unquestionably\\nthe upper half of an mand what was more the letter was slightly\\nchipped on one side\\n\\ngrail leaned over to subject the fragment to a second examination and\\nmake sure that he had not been misled then drew from his pocket the\\ncarbon copy of the note he had dictated to schilders stenographer and\\ncompared the two impressions they were alike defect and all as two\\npennies struck from the same die one was forced to the conclusion that\\nthey had been made by the same machine\\n\\ndropping his chin into his hand the adjutant sat staring almost\\nincredulously at the telltale speck in front of him this knocked into\\nsmithereens the entire theory he had evolved as to the disappearance of\\ncolonel vedant for despite the pains he had taken to secure a copy of\\nthe note from schilders typewriter he had never really believed that\\nthe original summons had come from there\\n\\nnow however he was driven to a fresh line of speculation recalling\\nthe foundry managers freely expressed insinuations he arose half\\nimpatiently and tested the two typewriting machines used at\\nheadquarters there were as he expected no point of similarity shown\\nwith the copy of the note he had caused to be transcribed by miss\\ngriffin the m on both machines was clearcut and flawless there was\\nno indication of blurring on the d\\n\\nreturning to the desk he resumed his perplexed contemplation of the\\nfragments on the sheet of carbon paper it seemed certain that schilder\\nmust have sent the decoy message relying on its speedy disintegration\\nto cover up his tracks and right there another consideration arose to\\nmuddle him how had this disintegration been accomplished hitherto he\\nhad been so intent on establishing the identity of these specks of\\ntypewriting with the missing message that he had not stopped to question\\nthe agency which could so quickly and thoroughly destroy a stout sheet\\nof linen paper\\n\\nsome powerful chemical doubtless he reflected recollecting that the\\nnote had been a trifle damp when he drew it from the envelope and with\\nthis suggestion he scraped together a little pinch of the dust to taste\\nand smell of it the tests confirmed his opinion there was a faint\\npungent odor to the particles which although familiar he could not\\nexactly place and one of them applied to his tongue produced a slight\\nburning sensation the paper undoubtedly had been treated with some\\nsolution which in drying reduced it to shreds\\n\\nhe carefully transferred what remained of it to an envelope in order to\\nhave his conclusions verified and the exact nature of the solvent\\ndetermined by expert analysis but he really needed no such\\ncorroboration he was fully satisfied that the demolition of the message\\nmust have been effected in the way he assumed\\n\\nwith so much settled though he seemed in no way relieved indeed the\\nfrown of perplexity on his forehead grew deeper and seated there\\nbefore his desk he fell into a brown study\\n\\nwhy he thought should schilder have gone to so much trouble to get rid\\nof this note when he could so easily have supported his denial of\\nwriting it by the simple expedient of using another machine as he\\nhimself had said to grail it would be quite a job without other clews\\nto trace among all the hundreds of machines in a city like brantford\\nthe particular one on which a specific communication was written\\n\\nno the adjutant said aloud fishing from his pocket the halfsmoked\\ncigarette he had found at the threshold of the foundry office and\\nsurveying it with a decisive nod i cant be so far off the track this\\nnew complication simply means that the trail is a bit more involved than\\ni thought howeverhe shrugged his shoulders with returning\\nresentmentthat is something for the bunch of wiseacres down the row\\nto work out im done with the whole business and once more he drew a\\nsheet of paper toward him to indite his resignation\\n\\nwith his pen dipped in the ink he hesitated there came a natural\\nreluctance to quit in this way under fire the fresh developments he had\\nunearthed too served as a challenge to his ingenuity he had a\\nwelldefined theory to account for the disappearance of the colonel\\nand after his first anxiety at schilders office had not entertained\\nany serious alarm as to the outcome it was he believed merely a bold\\nattempt on the part of some of the foreign spies who had been hanging\\naround the post of late to obtain information in regard to the\\nexperiments in progress there they must have become aware of the\\ncolonels habit of carrying home with him at night the reports made to\\nhim in order that he might digest them at his leisure since the coup\\nhad failed however colonel vedant having no papers with him that\\nevening and being the last person in the world to divulge under duress\\nor otherwise any official secrets grail felt satisfied that the captive\\nwould be released just as soon as those responsible for the outrage were\\nsafe beyond the reach of retribution\\n\\nhe had not really credited schilder with any hand in the affair on that\\none point at least he was agreed with lieutenant hemingway regarding\\nthe german merely as a rather thickheaded dupe who had unwittingly\\nallowed his establishment to be used as a theater for the enterprise\\n\\nnow however with the seeming assurance that this decoy message must\\nhave come from the typewriter at the foundry he began to wonder if he\\nhad not been taking too much for granted one was certainly justified in\\nbelieving that either the manager or his stenographer must have had\\nknowledge of the writing of the note\\n\\nsuppose grail speculated the assumption ive been going on is a\\nmistake by jove im not infallible and ive got no proof to support\\nmethat is nothing you could call real proof suppose then that\\ntheres more to this job than ive been willing to concede and that the\\nold colonel is actually in danger have i got the right merely from\\npersonal pique to stand from under and leave the old boy to the mercy\\nof a set of bunglers like appleby and his crew\\n\\nwhile he hesitated his glance happened to fall on the pen he still held\\nbetween his fingers which he had picked up from the desk at random it\\nwas a gold one belonging to the colonela gift from his daughter\\nmeredith as was shown by the tiny plate affixed to the handle with the\\ninscription merry christmas m l v\\n\\nbefore the adjutants mind rose suddenly the vision of the fairhaired\\nlovely girl so devotedly attached to her father he knew what this\\naffair would mean to her how deeply she would be affected whether\\nthere were any actual menace in the situation or not he laid down his\\npen and picking up the form of resignation he had drafted tore it\\nacross and dropped it into the wastebasket\\n\\nive got to stick it out he muttered ive got to stick it out and\\nclear this thing upfor her sake\\n\\nhis mind made up he threw himself wholeheartedly into his task a\\nglance at his watch showed him it was after three oclock but no\\nthought of sleep suggested itself to him instead he caught up his hat\\nand coat and started out to take another look over the scene of the\\ndisappearance\\n\\nbut there was nothing new to be gained he found the foundry yard\\nsilent and deserted now the last vestige of the scrap heaps cleared\\naway and only the idle crane with its long sweeping arm at rest to\\nserve as a reminder of the evenings earlier activity offered nothing\\nmore in the way of a clew nor could old dennis at the gate although\\ngarrulous enough add any fresh information to what he had already told\\n\\nleaving him after a brief colloquy grail thoughtfully strolled down to\\nthe railroad tracks skirting the banks of the river and patrolled them\\nslowly the length of the foundry inclosure and back climbing up on each\\nof the scraploaded freight cars standing on the siding to investigate\\nbut only to drop down again every time with a shake of the head the\\nnight was beginning to give way now to the first faint gray of the\\nsummer dawn more and more distinctly the different features of the\\nwater front revealed themselvesthe chimneys of the big smelter\\nbrantfords largest industry the railroad machine shops beyond and\\noverhead dark and shadowy against the sky the dim perspective of the\\ngreat bridge stretching across the stream\\n\\nthe horizon flushed into pink and crimson the gilded cross of a steeple\\noff in the distance flashed with the first beams of the rising sun\\nsomewhere up the river a factory whistle blew morning had come\\n\\nonly the wide river was invisible now blanketed in the thick mist which\\nstill hung over its swift muddy current grail stood a moment staring\\nout at the impenetrable veil then obliged to step nimbly from the\\ntracks for the passage of an express train turned and made his way\\nback past the gate of the foundry\\n\\nas he reached old dennis he halted suddenly and wheeled to glance\\nsharply once more out over the mistenveloped stream\\n\\nwhat is that noise he inquired\\n\\nthe old gateman cupped his wrinkled fingers behind his ear and bent his\\nhead to listen\\n\\nis it th choog choog choog ye mane he returned sure that must\\nbe a autymobile over in th bottoms\\n\\nno grail shook his head thats the exhaust of a motor boat if i\\never heard one\\n\\na motor boat scoffed dennis wid all thim sand bars out there sure\\ntheres a

boat out at the lake this summer\\neh\\n\\nas i tell ye sorr an sure it may be out there already fr all that i\\nknow he was dickerin wid a felly yisteday afthernoon to haul it out\\nfr him\\n\\ngrail merely nodded and turned the conversation to another channel the\\nchugchug which had caught his attention had faded away by this time\\nand there seemed nothing to keep him there but still he lingered on\\nchatting with the old watchman\\n\\nit might have been observed though that he directed an occasional keen\\nglance toward the mists thinning fast now in the rays of the rising\\nsun and that when at last the vapors were entirely dissipated and the\\nriver visible from shore to shore a little frown of disappointment\\ngathered between his eyes on all the broad expanse of the tawny stream\\nthere was no craft of any kind to be discerned he bade old dennis good\\nmorning and betook himself back to the post\\n\\n\\nto be continued\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntips to young pitchers\\n\\nhow to curve a ball\\n\\n\\nto be able to curve a ball is the ambition of every young player if he\\nhappens to be the pitcher of his team his desire is all the stronger\\nhe wants to fool the other fellows when they come to the bat he cannot\\nbe blamed for that but while curve pitching is undoubtedly a great\\naccomplishment it must be remembered that in the old days of baseball\\nmany brilliant battles were won with the straightarm delivery it is\\nnot absolutely necessary therefore to curve a ball in order to win\\nsuccess the writer vividly recalls the famous games in the early\\nseventies in the neighborhood of new york he was a boy then and walked\\nmiles to see the contests a curved ball was unknown then so far as the\\npitching was concerned and the pitchers were very effective too they\\nstudied the weakness of the batsmen just as the pitchers do now and\\nthat is the study all young pitchers must pursue begin your work by\\npitching a straight ball you cannot gain control in a better way as\\nyou are young in pitching experience so also are your opponents young\\nin their knowledge of batting if you watch them closely you will\\nperceive very quickly that nearly every one of them swings his bat at\\nabout the same height every time for instance you will notice that the\\nfirst batter will swing his bat just in front of his waistband in order\\nto fool him pitch the ball a little higher or a little lower than that\\npoint the next batter may snap his bat high give him a high ball but\\na few inches lower than he is likely to strike the rule is by no means\\ninfallible but it is a good one it takes a boy a long time to overcome\\nthe inclination to swing in the same way every time he strikes there is\\nanother important point to remember do not give the batsmen a chance to\\nhit the ball with the end of their bats if you can avoid it this is\\nsimple enough if the batter stands close to the plate you can keep the\\nball well in on him without much trouble but when he stands back in the\\nbox you must use discretion try to coax him with a ball or two just\\ninside the plate if he refuses to bite then of course youll have\\nto put it over as you improve in your work you can begin to practice\\ncurves\\n\\ncurve pitching cannot be taught by book or other directions it must be\\nlearned by actual practice and experience the principles of making a\\nball curve however may be explained let the young aspirant grasp the\\nball firmly in his hand giving the pressure with his forefinger and\\nmiddle finger the other two fingers should be drawn in toward the palm\\nnext let him snap the ball first out of one side of the hand and next\\nout of the other side he will soon learn the effect these movements\\nhave on the ball then he must practice faithfully to so control it as\\nto make the curves useful strange as it may seem it is much more\\ndifficult for the beginner to throw or pitch a straight ball than one\\nthat describes an arc in its course this is so because of the natural\\ntendency of the player to throw the ball out of the side of his hand to\\npitch a straight ball it is necessary that the two fingers which grasp\\nthe ball should be straight up and down with their backs in front of\\nthe player as he throws beyond these few hints it is almost impossible\\nto give any intelligible instructions it will depend almost entirely on\\nthe young players ability inclination and perseverance how much of a\\nsuccess he will make at curve pitching he cannot have too much\\npractice but he should take care not to overexert himself it is not\\nnecessary to exert all his force he can practice curves without putting\\nhis greatest speed into the ball\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndrunken monkeys\\n\\n\\ndid you ever hear that monkeys were an intemperate race of creatures it\\nis true they actually get tipsy when they get the chance but the\\npunishment of their crime is something terrible even for a tipsy monkey\\nthey are not merely taken to prison for safety and locked up for a few\\nhours there are no monkey policemen to do them that service and we\\nhave not heard that there are any monkey magistrates to give them a\\nsevere lecture in the morning fine them a few dollars and tell them\\nnot to do it any more no it seems there are none of these beautiful\\nprovisions for jackos safety and comfort provided in his native land\\nand so he falls into the hands of his enemies and lifelong\\nimprisonment or even banishment to colder climates is the punishment\\n\\nlike men monkeys are easily outwitted when under the influence of\\nliquor they have human vices and love stimulants in darfour and sena\\nafrica the natives make a fermented beer of which the monkeys

and tastes it he\\nutters loud cries of joy that soon attract his comrades then an orgy\\nbegins and in a short time they all show degrees of intoxication then\\nthe negroes appear some of the drinkers are too far gone to distrust\\nthem but apparently take them for larger species of their own genus\\nthe negroes take some up and these begin to weep and cover them with\\nmaudlin kisses when the negro takes one by the hand to lead him off\\nthe nearest monkey will cling to the one who thus finds a support and\\nendeavor to go on also\\n\\nanother will clutch at him and so on until the negro leads a\\nstaggering line of ten or a dozen tipsy monkeys when finally brought to\\nthe village they are securely caged and gradually sobered down but for\\ntwo or three days a gradually

next\\nfifteen or twenty years in clearing the land and bringing it into a high\\nstate of cultivation and then suppose that just when you had begun to\\nderive some benefit from your years of toil the river should suddenly\\nreach out and swallow up about half your farm\\n\\nthen suppose that the river after keeping your farm for several years\\nshould grow seemingly repentant and replace your farm you would no\\ndoubt feel that all the land within the bounds mentioned in your deeds\\nwas your own as much as it ever was\\n\\nbut that would all depend on the precise manner in which the river\\nreplaced your land that is where the accretion law of missouri comes\\nin and it is a fearful and mysterious thing if the river in putting\\nyour land back began piling it up against your bank and continued doing\\nso the land to the waters edge would be yours even if it went beyond\\nyour original boundaries but if the river as it often does should\\nfirst throw up a bar out in the channel and then gradually fill up the\\nspace between that and your land until finally the current changed and\\nleft the island thus formed joined to your land you would have no claim\\nto any land thus formed it would belong to the county and could be\\nsurveyed and sold to the highest bidder and the money it brought would\\ngo to the school fund\\n\\nthe missouri river is a malicious stream and if it ever comes to\\njudgment will have a lot to answer for instead of pursuing its course\\nin an orderly manner and sticking to one established course it is\\nforever changing eating away the bank on one side and throwing up new\\nbanks on the other side cutting out old sand bars here and building new\\nones there so that the main channel is never the same for very long at\\na time\\n\\nin holt county near fortescue there has been a great deal of\\nexcitement lately caused by the disputes over the possession of some of\\nthe land thus formed commonly known as bar land several men had\\nfenced land which was claimed under deed by john c hinkle a civil war\\nveteran who has lived on this land for the last fifty years about\\nfifteen years ago the river took five hundred acres of mr hinkles land\\nand afterward put it back as a bar mr hinkle claimed the land on the\\nground that the bar had made to his land and the other men claimed it\\non the ground that it had been put back as an island which finally\\njoined mr hinkles land and was therefore as much theirs as any ones\\nthe court upheld the squatters claim that the land did not belong to\\nhinkle and this decision was the signal for squatters to rush in and\\nseize bar land all along the river front in the last thirty days\\nperhaps a dozen men have settled on these bars\\n\\nthe fact of possession seems to be given considerable weight in this\\nmatter and the land has generally been seized in the night a squatter\\nwill pick out a piece of land that most suits his fancy get some help\\nslip in at night put a fence around it and build a shack on it of\\ncourse it is not much of a house or much of a fence but it is enough\\nto establish proof of possession\\n\\nsometimes two different men will have designs on the same piece of land\\nor perhaps the man whose deed calls for this land will offer objections\\nto its being seized and these conditions have given rise to several\\nexciting encounters several houses have been torn down many fences cut\\nto pieces and in at least one instance men have been escorted from the\\nland of their choice at the point of a winchester with instruction to\\nbeat it and not to come back while no blood has been shed so far it\\nis freely predicted that it is only a matter of time until somebody is\\ncarried out feet first\\n\\nthe county has ordered the land surveyed with the intention of selling\\nit to the highest bidder but the law says that the ones in possession\\nhave a right to buy it at the highest bid so that even if the county\\nsells the land the ones actually on the ground have a big advantage\\nthis fact will probably cause others to try to seize land before the\\nsurvey is made\\n\\nthe land is not so very valuable except in a

it down and out\\n\\nall through the multiplication table the product of nine comes to nine\\nno matter what you multiply with or how many times you repeat or change\\nthe figures the result is always the same\\n\\nfor instance twice nine equals eighteen add eight and one and you\\nhave nine three times nine equals twentyseven two and seven make nine\\nagain go on until you try eleven times nine equals ninetynine this\\nseems to bring an exception but add the digitsnine and nine make\\neighteen and again one and eight make nine go on to an indeterminable\\nextent and the thing continues take any number at random for example\\n times nine equals  and the digits added make nine once more\\ntake  times  equals  and again you have five and four\\n\\ntake any rows of figures reverse the order and subtract the lesser\\nfrom the greaterthe difference will certainly be always nine or a\\nmultiple of nine for example  minus  equals  add these\\ndigits and you have eighteen and one and eight make the familiar nine\\n\\nyou have the same result no matter how you raise the numbers by squares\\nand cubes\\n\\none more way is given by which number nine shows its strange powers\\nwrite down any number you please add its digits and then subtract the\\nsum of said digits from the original number no matter what numbers you\\nstart with the sum of the digits in the answer will be nine\\n\\ntry these experiments and you will be delighted with the exact manner\\nin which they prove the statement some quaint puzzles have been made\\nbased on these fixed principles\\n\\n\\nlaunch
